The news comes two months after she had temporarily stepped away from public life following what Kensington Palace said at the time was surgery for a non-cancerous abdominal condition.\\n\\n\\u201cIn January, I underwent major abdominal surgery in London and at the time, it was thought that my condition was non-cancerous,\\u201d said Catherine, 42, who is married to the heir to the British throne, Prince William.\\n\\n\\u201cThe surgery was successful. However, tests after the operation found cancer had been present. My medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventative chemotherapy and I am now in the early stages of that treatment.\\u201d\\n\\nCatherine, Princess of Wales during a Portage Session for her 'Shaping Us' campaign on early childhood, taken September 27, 2023 in Sittingbourne, England. Paul Grover/WPA Pool/Getty Images\\n\\nKate continued that \\u201cWilliam and I have been doing everything we can to process and manage this privately for the sake of our young family.\\u201d\\n\\nThe princess added, \\u201cAs you can imagine, this has taken time. It has taken me time to recover from major surgery in order to start my treatment. But, most importantly, it has taken us time to explain everything to George, Charlotte and Louis in a way that is appropriate for them, and to reassure them that I am going to be ok.\\u201d\\n\\nKate said that she had told them she is \\u201cwell and getting stronger every day by focusing on the things that will help me heal; in my mind, body and spirits.\\u201d\\n\\nShe praised Prince William for being by her side as \\u201ca great source of comfort and reassurance\\u201d as well as the support she has received from the public.\\n\\n\\u201cWe hope that you will understand that, as a family, we now need some time, space and privacy while I complete my treatment. My work has always brought me a deep sense of joy and I look forward to being back when I am able, but for now I must focus on making a full recovery,\\u201d the princess said.\\n\\nShe ended her heartfelt message by saying that she was also keeping \\u201call those whose lives have been affected by cancer\\u201d in her thoughts.\\n\\n\\u201cFor everyone facing this disease, in whatever form, please do not lose faith or hope.

She remained in the hospital for 13 days following the procedure and, on doctor\\u2019s advice, had since been away from public duties during her recovery.\\n\\nKate was spotted in public for the first time since her surgery, visiting a farm shop with her husband Prince William last weekend, amid intense speculation about her health and whereabouts.\\n\\nSince the announcement on Friday, well wishes have poured in for the princess.\\n\\nPrince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex said in a joint statement that they \\u201cwish health and healing for Kate and the family, and hope they are able to do so privately and in peace.\\u201d\\n\\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement that the princess had \\u201cthe love and support of the whole country,\\u201d adding that Kate had shown \\u201ctremendous bravery\\u201d and that she had been \\u201cunfairly treated\\u201d during weeks of \\u201cintense scrutiny\\u201d by the press and on social media.

But it has yet to pull it off during regular trading hours.\\n\\nStill, the blue-chip index notched its best week since December. All three major indexes finished two consecutive sessions at record highs on Wednesday and Thursday and the tech-heavy Nasdaq set a third record on Friday, at 16,428.82.\\n\\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.1% on Friday and the Nasdaq was 0.2% higher.\\n\\nAll three indexes had a winning week: The S&P 500 rose 2.3%, the Dow was up about 2% and the Nasdaq gained 2.9%.\\n\\nA surge in artificial intelligence stocks fueled two new record highs across the three major indexes this week, along with fresh projections from the Federal Reserve that the US economy will see three interest rate cuts before the year is out.\\n\\nIn corporate news, it\\u2019s been a rough day for performance wear.\\n\\nShares of Lululemon slid nearly 15.8% after the company issued weak forward guidance. The athletic-wear company registered its worst day since March 2020. Shares of Nike also dropped 6.9% after it reported that sales were slowing in China and also adjusted its forward guidance.\\n\\nReddit entered its second official day of trading with a downward adjustment \\u2014 shares were down about 8.5% after springing 48% higher following its debut on the New York Stock Exchange.\\n\\nApple investors appeared to be relatively unbothered by a Department of Justice antitrust suit brought against the iPhone maker on Thursday. Shares were about 0.5% higher.\\n\\nInvestors also approved a deal on Friday to make Truth Social owner Trump Media a publicly traded company.\\n\\nThe green light from shareholders clears a major hurdle for a long-delayed merger that will generate a multibillion-dollar windfall for former President Donald Trump at a time when he\\u2019s facing immense financial and legal pressure. However, it\\u2019s not likely to help his legal woes.\\n\\nAccording to a preliminary vote total announced during the meeting, a majority of shareholders of Digital World Acquisition Corp. voted in favor of the deal to merge with Trump Media. The companies have indicated the merger could close as soon as early next week.\\n\\nBut not all shareholders appeared to be in an approving mood.

Ranga Dias, a researcher and assistant professor at the University of Rochester, has been under investigation by a committee of outside experts since last August over concerns about the accuracy of his findings.\n",

      "Last year, Dias co-authored a research paper in Nature highlighting a nitrogen-doped lutetium hydride. The paper claimed the material could conduct electricity at ambient temperatures without resistance.

      "In anticipation of its merger with Trump Media, shares of DWAC popped more than 100% this year. Trading has embodied the same kind of frenzy shown in Tupperware’s stock surge last July, or that of meme stocks AMC Entertainment and GameStop during the height of the pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump Media saw a $26 million loss during the third quarter of last year, and many experts are questioning whether it is a solid bet — or dramatically overvalued.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The stock price is clearly a bubble,” Yale law professor Jonathan Macey told CNN. “No rational investor would take the stock at face value, especially if they had to hold it for any length of time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Shares of DWAC declined 13.7% on Friday.\n",
      "\n",
      "DWAC and Trump Media did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is a meme stock?\n",
      "\n",
      "Meme stocks are characterized by a cult online following and jaw-dropping swings in their price. The first meme stock was GameStop. Investors on Reddit and other social media sites in 2021 decided to bid up shares of the struggling stock to punish hedge funds and institutional firms who hoped to turn a profit from short-selling GameStop’s stock. Short-selling involves borrowing the shares, selling them and buying them back, ideally at a lower price, before returning them and pocketing any profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Truth Social, there are more than 8,000 members in a chat group titled “The DWAC Shareholder Group,” where users discuss the vote and post memes and supportive messages.\n",
      "\n",
      "A list of rules pinned to the top of the chat forbids members from promoting short-selling, and urges users to provide evidence such as public filings when posting their opinions or recommendations on the new company, which would trade as Trump Media & Technology Group.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We don’t want to be accused of stock pumping or misleading investors,” one rule notes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Separately, Trump faces an upcoming Monday deadline to secure a $464 million bond in a civil fraud case against him. The New York attorney general’s office could seize his golf course and private estate north of Manhattan, or other assets, if he can’t pay up.\n",
      "\n",
      "That means that Trump is strapped for cash. If the merger is approved, it would give him a dominant stake in his firm with shares worth more than $3 billion dollars. But it’s unlikely to solve his cash crunch: Key shareholders of Trump Media, including its management team, have agreed not to sell their common stock for six months to maintain “important stability to the leadership and governance” of the company, according to SEC filings.\n",

      "Study: Assessing the visual appeal of real/AI-generated food images. Image Credit: Pinkyone / Shutterstock.com\n",
      "\n",
      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent advancements in generative AI models have blurred the distinction between reality and artificiality. These models are highly sophisticated and can learn to create new content based on the underlying training dataset. OpenAI's ChatGPT is an example of a generative AI model that has gained significant attention worldwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "AI-generated food imagery is a relatively new field with significant implications for online grocery platforms, the hospitality sector, and direct-to-consumer services. A recent United Kingdom-based survey conducted in 2023 investigated the public perception of AI-generated and authentic food images, given its importance for a wide range of businesses, including those with scarce resources, time, or budgets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Potential concerns with AI-based food imagery include the intensification of 'visual hunger,' which entails triggering appetite and food cravings when viewing images, and the need for clear disclosure policies regarding the AI-generated nature of food images. These concerns motivate further study on the connections between consumer perception and AI-based food imagery.\n",
      "\n",
      "About the study\n",
      "\n",
      "Using two sub-studies, researchers explored the ability of study participants to differentiate between authentic and AI-generated food images and whether this is influenced by the degree of food processing. They also assessed the perceived appeal of AI-generated food images and the role of food processing relative to authentic images. The impact of disclosing the photo's nature on these assessments was also studied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Milk: real (top row) and AI-generated (bottom row) in its unprocessed (left), processed (middle), and ultra-processed (right) variants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Potatoes: real (top row) and AI-generated (bottom row) in their unprocessed (left), processed (middle), and ultra-processed (right) variants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apples: real (top row) and AI-generated (bottom row) in their unprocessed (left), processed (middle), and ultra-processed (right) variants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Study findings\n",
      "\n",
      "Participants of the first study performed very well in identifying AI-generated food photographs, especially when a joint evaluation mode was used. According to the General Evaluability Theory, individuals can use features of an image to evaluate another in joint evaluations, which augments a photo's evaluability and people's sensitivity to its value.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast to separate evaluation, the joint evaluation mode may have helped individuals accurately distinguish between authentic and AI-generated food images. For ultra-processed foods (UPFs), recognition was higher, which could be due the high degree of manipulation associated with UPFs, with AI-modifications potentially making UPFs more artificial and conspicuous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consistent with other studies, the rate of recognition for AI-generated photos was lower than for real images, which could be due to participants' lifelong exposure to real food. Importantly, the ability to identify AI-generated and real food was uncorrelated. With the progression of age, the ability to differentiate between AI-generated and real images decreased.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second study evaluated the influence of labeling on the perceived appeal of food images. Without disclosure, authentic images were consistently rated less appetizing than their AI-generated counterparts. Comparatively, with disclosure, participants' preferences tended to shift towards images labeled as real, independent of the actual nature of the food.\n",
      "\n",
      "In cases where participants were deceived or unaware of the nature of the food, unprocessed foods were considered more appealing in their AI-based formats. In the \"informed\" or correctly labeled condition, real images were considered more appetizing than their AI-generated counterparts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusions\n",
      "\n",
      "The study findings provide new insights into the nuanced relationship between consumer perceptions and AI-generated food imagery. Moreover, this study explores the complex interplay between human responses and technological innovation in digital food marketing.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the results suggest an opportunity for marketers and the industry, there could also be the potential exacerbation of 'visual hunger,' which has the potential to contribute to unhealthy eating behaviors. To address this, clear disclosure of the content's origin is extremely important.\n",
      "\n",
      "A key limitation of the study involves the representativeness of the general population. The above 65-year age group was less represented, thus limiting the generalizability of the findings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Specific stimuli generated by a specific AI model were used in this study. This implies that the findings may not apply to other AI models, which could yield different degrees of realism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Importantly, generative models are advancing rapidly; therefore, the current study findings correspond to a particular snapshot in time and have associated limitations. Future research is needed to continue to validate and build upon these observations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the future, more research should be conducted on \"comfort foods,\" where an emotional connection could mediate the acceptance of digital content. These types of studies must account for differences in the definition of comfort foods across geographical locations and genders. Another intriguing research direction could be assessing the role of food aromas on the perception of naturalness.\n",

      "The crew’s next opportunity to launch is Saturday morning, but whether it goes forward depends on if engineers can determine the cause of the automatic abort and resolve it in time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The abort was triggered “by ground support equipment due to low voltage reading in the Soyuz rocket electrical system,” according to an update shared by NASA. Saturday’s launch window is dependent on when the State Commission review for the Roscosmos launch is complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "The abort did not impact the launch of a separate cargo resupply mission, which lifted off at 4:55 p.m. ET from Cape Canaveral in Florida and will dock at the space station Saturday morning.

For me, my last three years living off-grid have been about removing a lot of clutter from my life, deepening relationships with the remaining people and things I kept around, and finally facing up to some personal shortcomings.\n",
      "\n",
      "That insecurity can be traced to my early twenties, when I moved to Alaska for a job and found myself living alone in the sub-Arctic and barely able to take care of myself. Everything in my provided housing (an inadequately insulated trailer) was frozen, including the water in my toilet.

The traditional advice has been to make a down payment that's about 20% of the price of the home, however, Chase offers a loan option called the DreaMaker loan that would allow homebuyers to make a down payment that's as low as 3% (by comparison, the FHA loan requires borrowers to make a 3.5% down payment). This option is made for those who can only afford a smaller down payment, but it also comes with stricter income requirements compared to their other loans (the annual income used to qualify the customer must not exceed 80% of the Area Median Income (AMI), according to the Chase team). If you meet the income requirements for the DreaMaker loan, this option could be very attractive for those who would prefer to make a down payment that's as small as possible so they can have more money reserved for other homebuying expenses. In addition to the DreaMaker loan, Chase also offers a conventional loan, FHA loan, VA loan and jumbo loan (USDA loans and HELOCs are not offered by this lender). This lender also offers discounts for existing customers, but the requirements are rather high: For $500 off your mortgage processing fee, you need to have $150,000–$499,999 between Chase deposit accounts and Chase investment accounts; $500,000 or more in these accounts can get you up to $1,150 off the processing fee.\n",

According to Ally Bank's mortgage website, you can get pre-approved for a mortgage in as little as three minutes — and when it comes to submitting your application for this lender, most borrowers can expect to complete their application in as little as 15 minutes. The ease of this process can be very attractive to those who don't want to spend what can easily feel like hours mulling over an application. Ally also charges fewer fees compared to most lenders. It's common for lenders to charge an application fee, origination fee, processing fee and underwriting fee — these fees can end up costing a significant amount during the home-buying process. Ally Bank doesn't charge any of these fees (they may, however, charge an appraisal fee and recording fee, and may charge for title search and insurance). Ally offers a HomeReady mortgage program that is geared toward low- to mid-income homebuyers (regardless of whether it's their first time or if they're a repeat buyer) that would allow them to put down as little as 3% for a down payment. Applicants must also have a debt-to-income ratio of no more than 50%, their income must be equal to or less than 80% of the area's median income and at least one borrower must take a homeowner education course. In addition to this loan option, homebuyers can also apply for a jumbo loan (FHA loans, VA and USDA loans are not available through this lender).\n",

      "How mortgages work\n",
      "\n",
      "A mortgage is a type of loan that you can use to purchase a home. It's also an agreement between you and the lender that essentially says that you can purchase a home without paying for it in-full upfront — you'll just put some of the money down upfront (usually between 3% and 20% of the home price) and pay smaller, fixed equal monthly payments for a certain number of years plus interest. For example, you probably can't pay $400,000 for a home upfront, however, maybe you can afford to pay $30,000 upfront; a mortgage would allow you to make that $30,000 payment while a lender gives you a loan for $370,000 (the remaining amount) and you agree to repay that amount plus interest to the lender over 15 or 30 years. Keep in mind that if you choose to put down less than 20%, you'll be subject to private mortgage insurance (PMI) payments in addition to your monthly mortgage payments. However, you can usually have the PMI waived after you've made enough payments to build 20% equity in your home.\n",
      "\n",
      "FAQs What is pre-approval and how does it work? Pre-approval is a statement or letter from a lender that details how much money you can borrow to purchase a home and what your interest rate might be. To get pre-approved, you may have to provide bank statements, pay stubs, tax forms and employment verification, to name a few. Once you're pre-approved, you'll receive a mortgage pre-approval letter, which you can use to begin viewing homes and start making offers. It's best to get pre-approved at the start of your home-buying journey before you start looking at homes. What is a conventional loan? A conventional loan is a loan that's funded by private lenders and sold to government enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It's the most common type of loan and some lenders may require a down payment as low as 3% or 5% for this loan. What is an FHA loan? A Federal Housing Administration loan (FHA loan) is a loan that typically allows you to purchase a home with looser requirements. For example, this type of loan may allow you to get approved with a lower credit score and applicants may be able to get away with a higher debt-to-income ratio. You typically only need a 3.5% down payment with an FHA loan. What is a USDA loan? A USDA loan is offered through the United States Department of Agriculture and is aimed at individuals who want to purchase a home in a rural area. A USDA loan requires a minimum down payment of 0% — in other words, you can use this loan to buy a rural home without making a down payment. What is a VA loan? A VA mortgage loan is provided through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and is meant for service members, veterans and their spouses. They require a 0% down payment and no mortgage insurance. What is a jumbo loan? A jumbo loan is a mortgage loan of at least $726,200 (in most areas). Jumbo loans exceed conforming loan limits, which means they tend to have stricter credit score and down payment requirements. How is my mortgage rate decided? Mortgage rates change almost daily and can depend on market forces such as inflation and the overall economy. While the Federal Reserve doesn't set mortgage rates, mortgage rates tend to move in reaction to actions taken by the Federal Reserve on its interest rates. Market forces may influence the general range of mortgage rates but your specific mortgage rate will depend on your location, credit report and credit score. The higher your credit score, the more likely you are to be qualified for a lower mortgage interest rate. What is the difference between a 15-year and a 30-year term? A 15-year mortgage gives homeowners 15 years to pay off their mortgage in fixed, equal amounts plus interest. By contrast, a 30-year mortgage gives homeowners 30 years to pay off their mortgage. With a 30-year mortgage, your monthly payments will be lower since you'll have a longer period of time to pay off the loan. However, you'll wind up paying more in interest over the life of the loan since interest is charged monthly. A 15-year mortgage lets you save on interest but you will likely have a higher monthly payment.\n",

      "\n",
      "To determine which mortgage lenders are the best, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of U.S. mortgages offered by both online and brick-and-mortar banks, including large credit unions, that come with fixed-rate APRs and flexible loan amounts and terms to suit an array of financing needs. When narrowing down and ranking the best mortgages, we focused on the following features: Fixed-rate APR: Variable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan. With a fixed rate APR, you lock in an interest rate for the duration of the loan's term, which means your monthly payment won't vary, making your budget easier to plan.\n",

We also opted for lenders with an online resource hub or advice center to help you educate yourself about the personal loan process and your finances. Minimum down payment: Although minimum down payment amounts depend on the type of loan a borrower applies for, we noted lenders that offer additional specialty loans that come with a lower minimum down payment amount. After reviewing the above features, we sorted our recommendations by best for overall financing needs, quick closing timeline, lower interest rates and flexible terms. Note that the rates and fee structures advertised for mortgages are subject to fluctuate in accordance with the Fed rate. However, once you accept your mortgage agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee interest rate and monthly payment will remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan, unless you choose to refinance your mortgage at a later date for a potentially lower APR. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history, creditworthiness, debt-to-income ratio and the desired loan term. To take out a mortgage, lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more.

      "Pope Francis decided at the last minute to skip his homily during Palm Sunday Mass in St. Peter's Square, avoiding a strenuous speech at the start of a busy Holy Week that will test his increasingly frail health.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hobbled by bad knees and persistent respiratory problems, Francis also didn't participate in the procession of cardinals around the obelisk in the piazza at the start of the Mass. Instead, the 87-year-old pontiff blessed the palm fronds and olive branches carried by the faithful from the altar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Francis had been expected to deliver a homily halfway through the service and a prepared text had been distributed to journalists. But when an aide presented Francis with his glasses to begin reading, the pope made clear he wouldn't deliver the remarks, leaving the crowd waiting in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vatican officials didn't immediately explain why. The Vatican press office later said the homily was replaced by \"a moment of silence and prayer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Francis though did pronounce prayers throughout the service and offered a long appeal for peace at the end of the Mass. He said he was praying for the families of those killed in what he called an \"inhuman\" attack at a suburban Moscow concert hall and also asked for prayers for \"the martyred Ukraine\" and people of Gaza.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vatican officials estimated some 60,000 people attended the Mass, held under a sunny, breezy spring sky. Francis spent several minutes greeting them from the popemobile, making several loops around the piazza at the end of the service.\n",
      "\n",
      "Palm Sunday kicks off a busy week for Francis leading up to Easter Sunday when the faithful commemorate the resurrection of Christ. On Thursday, Francis is due to travel to a Rome women's prison for the traditional washing of the feet ritual. On Friday he is scheduled to preside over the torchlit Way of the Cross procession at Rome's Colosseum re-enacting Christ's crucifixion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following day marks the Easter Vigil, during which Francis presides over a solemn nighttime service in the basilica, followed by Easter Sunday Mass in St. Peter's Square and his noontime blessing from the loggia above.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Holy Week schedule is challenging for popes even under the best of circumstances. But that is especially true this year for Francis, who has been battling on and off all winter what he and the Vatican have described as a case of the flu, bronchitis or a cold. For the last several weeks he has occasionally asked an aide to read aloud his speeches and catechism lessons to spare him the effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Sunday, there was no substitute called in, and the homily was skipped. Vatican officials said the prepared text was to be considered as never having existed. Usually, the pope doesn't deliver a homily at Easter, but he traditionally offers reflections on Palm Sunday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even when he isn't sick, Francis often speaks in a whisper and seems to run out of breath easily. He had part of one lung removed when he was a young man because of a respiratory infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this time last year, he was hospitalized for three days with an acute case of bronchitis, but then rallied to get through Holy Week. He has been hospitalized two other times during his pontificate for abdominal surgery, including one 10-day stay in 2021 to remove a part of his large intestine.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the Mass, Francis offered a long prayer for peace for all those suffering from war, and for the Lord to comfort the victims of the \"vile terrorist attack\" in Moscow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"May he convert the hearts of those who protect, organize and carry out these inhuman acts that offend God, who commanded us not to kill,\" Francis said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without citing Moscow, Francis also asked the faithful not to forget Ukraine's suffering. He noted many Ukrainians are now without electricity as a result of \"intense attacks on infrastructure, which not only bring death and suffering, but also the risk of a humanitarian catastrophe of even bigger dimensions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please don't forget the martyred Ukraine,\" he said. \"And let us also think of Gaza, which is suffering so much, and so many other places of war.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Continuous glucose monitors, or CGMs, are small sensors that poke through the skin to track glucose levels in real-time. They are primarily used by patients with diabetes. Information is wirelessly sent to a smartphone, and can help alert users, their families, and their doctors to emergencies.\n",

      "Dexcom's new CGM is designed for patients with Type 2 diabetes who do not use insulin, and it is the first glucose biosensor that does not require a prescription. This means Stelo will be accessible to people who do not have insurance coverage for CGMs, Dexcom said.\n",

      "There are more than 25 million Type 2 diabetes patients in the U.S. that do not use insulin, according to the release from Dexcom. While Dexcom's existing G7 CGM system is available to this population, patients have to get a prescription for it. As a result, it's not easily accessible to all Type 2 patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"CGMs can be a powerful tool to help monitor blood glucose. Today's clearance expands access to these devices by allowing individuals to purchase a CGM without the involvement of a health care provider,\" Dr. Jeff Shuren, director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a release.\n",

      "\n",
      "Jake Leach, chief operating officer at Dexcom, told CNBC in February that Stelo will have a unique platform and branding.

      "Who's this for? Chase Bank provides several options for homebuyers, including for those who can afford to make a larger down payment or for those who would prefer to put less money down. The traditional advice has been to make a down payment that's about 20% of the price of the home, however, Chase offers a loan option called the DreaMaker loan that would allow homebuyers to make a down payment that's as low as 3% (by comparison, the FHA loan requires borrowers to make a 3.5% down payment). This option is made for those who can only afford a smaller down payment, but it also comes with stricter income requirements compared to their other loans (the annual income used to qualify the customer must not exceed 80% of the Area Median Income (AMI), according to the Chase team). If you meet the income requirements for the DreaMaker loan, this option could be very attractive for those who would prefer to make a down payment that's as small as possible so they can have more money reserved for other homebuying expenses. In addition to the DreaMaker loan, Chase also offers a conventional loan, FHA loan, VA loan and jumbo loan (USDA loans and HELOCs are not offered by this lender). This lender also offers discounts for existing customers, but the requirements are rather high: For $500 off your mortgage processing fee, you need to have $150,000–$499,999 between Chase deposit accounts and Chase investment accounts; $500,000 or more in these accounts can get you up to $1,150 off the processing fee.\n",

According to Ally Bank's mortgage website, you can get pre-approved for a mortgage in as little as three minutes — and when it comes to submitting your application for this lender, most borrowers can expect to complete their application in as little as 15 minutes. The ease of this process can be very attractive to those who don't want to spend what can easily feel like hours mulling over an application. Ally also charges fewer fees compared to most lenders. It's common for lenders to charge an application fee, origination fee, processing fee and underwriting fee — these fees can end up costing a significant amount during the home-buying process. Ally Bank doesn't charge any of these fees (they may, however, charge an appraisal fee and recording fee, and may charge for title search and insurance). Ally offers a HomeReady mortgage program that is geared toward low- to mid-income homebuyers (regardless of whether it's their first time or if they're a repeat buyer) that would allow them to put down as little as 3% for a down payment. Applicants must also have a debt-to-income ratio of no more than 50%, their income must be equal to or less than 80% of the area's median income and at least one borrower must take a homeowner education course. In addition to this loan option, homebuyers can also apply for a jumbo loan (FHA loans, VA and USDA loans are not available through this lender).\n",

      "Who's this for? SoFi offers homebuyers a number of discounts that can help them save as much money as possible throughout their home-buying process. For example, when you lock in 30-year rate for a conventional loan, you can receive a 0.25% discount on your interest rate. And when you purchase a home through the SoFi Real Estate Center, which is powered by HomeStory, you can receive up to $9,500 in cash back. Another appealing perk is that SoFi members can get a $500 discount on their mortgage loan. This lender offers an online-only experience for those looking to qualify for a conventional loan, jumbo loan, or HELOC (SoFi doesn't offer FHA, VA, or USDA mortgage loans). Homebuyers can also take advantage of a host of resources from SoFi, like a home affordability calculator, a mortgage calculator and a home improvement cost calculator, which can really come in handy if you're purchasing a home that needs some work done and you need to figure out ahead of time how much to budget for renovations.\n",

      "Who's this for? It's sometimes tough to find lenders that offer USDA loans in addition to other standard mortgage options, but PNC Bank includes USDA loans in their lineup. This lender also offers conventional loans, FHA loans, VA loans, jumbo loans and a PNC Bank Community Loan, which is a special program that allows homebuyers to put down as little as 3% (without paying private mortgage insurance) while still choosing between fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage terms. This lender also offers a special loan option catered to medical professionals who are looking to buy a primary residence only. With this loan, medical professionals can apply for as much as $1 million and won't have to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI), regardless of their down payment amount. They can also choose between fixed-rate and adjustable-rate terms. PNC Bank offers online and in-person mortgage application processes, which can be a plus for homebuyers who don't live near a PNC Bank location but still want to apply for a loan. You can get online pre-approval in as little as 30 minutes as long as you have all the documentation on hand.\n",

      "How mortgages work\n",
      "\n",
      "A mortgage is a type of loan that you can use to purchase a home. It's also an agreement between you and the lender that essentially says that you can purchase a home without paying for it in-full upfront — you'll just put some of the money down upfront (usually between 3% and 20% of the home price) and pay smaller, fixed equal monthly payments for a certain number of years plus interest. For example, you probably can't pay $400,000 for a home upfront, however, maybe you can afford to pay $30,000 upfront; a mortgage would allow you to make that $30,000 payment while a lender gives you a loan for $370,000 (the remaining amount) and you agree to repay that amount plus interest to the lender over 15 or 30 years. Keep in mind that if you choose to put down less than 20%, you'll be subject to private mortgage insurance (PMI) payments in addition to your monthly mortgage payments. However, you can usually have the PMI waived after you've made enough payments to build 20% equity in your home.\n",
      "\n",
      "FAQs What is pre-approval and how does it work? Pre-approval is a statement or letter from a lender that details how much money you can borrow to purchase a home and what your interest rate might be. To get pre-approved, you may have to provide bank statements, pay stubs, tax forms and employment verification, to name a few. Once you're pre-approved, you'll receive a mortgage pre-approval letter, which you can use to begin viewing homes and start making offers. It's best to get pre-approved at the start of your home-buying journey before you start looking at homes. What is a conventional loan? A conventional loan is a loan that's funded by private lenders and sold to government enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It's the most common type of loan and some lenders may require a down payment as low as 3% or 5% for this loan. What is an FHA loan? A Federal Housing Administration loan (FHA loan) is a loan that typically allows you to purchase a home with looser requirements. For example, this type of loan may allow you to get approved with a lower credit score and applicants may be able to get away with a higher debt-to-income ratio. You typically only need a 3.5% down payment with an FHA loan. What is a USDA loan? A USDA loan is offered through the United States Department of Agriculture and is aimed at individuals who want to purchase a home in a rural area. A USDA loan requires a minimum down payment of 0% — in other words, you can use this loan to buy a rural home without making a down payment. What is a VA loan? A VA mortgage loan is provided through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and is meant for service members, veterans and their spouses. They require a 0% down payment and no mortgage insurance. What is a jumbo loan? A jumbo loan is a mortgage loan of at least $726,200 (in most areas). Jumbo loans exceed conforming loan limits, which means they tend to have stricter credit score and down payment requirements. How is my mortgage rate decided? Mortgage rates change almost daily and can depend on market forces such as inflation and the overall economy. While the Federal Reserve doesn't set mortgage rates, mortgage rates tend to move in reaction to actions taken by the Federal Reserve on its interest rates. Market forces may influence the general range of mortgage rates but your specific mortgage rate will depend on your location, credit report and credit score. The higher your credit score, the more likely you are to be qualified for a lower mortgage interest rate. What is the difference between a 15-year and a 30-year term? A 15-year mortgage gives homeowners 15 years to pay off their mortgage in fixed, equal amounts plus interest. By contrast, a 30-year mortgage gives homeowners 30 years to pay off their mortgage. With a 30-year mortgage, your monthly payments will be lower since you'll have a longer period of time to pay off the loan. However, you'll wind up paying more in interest over the life of the loan since interest is charged monthly. A 15-year mortgage lets you save on interest but you will likely have a higher monthly payment.\n",

When narrowing down and ranking the best mortgages, we focused on the following features: Fixed-rate APR: Variable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan. With a fixed rate APR, you lock in an interest rate for the duration of the loan's term, which means your monthly payment won't vary, making your budget easier to plan.\n",

We also opted for lenders with an online resource hub or advice center to help you educate yourself about the personal loan process and your finances. Minimum down payment: Although minimum down payment amounts depend on the type of loan a borrower applies for, we noted lenders that offer additional specialty loans that come with a lower minimum down payment amount. After reviewing the above features, we sorted our recommendations by best for overall financing needs, quick closing timeline, lower interest rates and flexible terms. Note that the rates and fee structures advertised for mortgages are subject to fluctuate in accordance with the Fed rate. However, once you accept your mortgage agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee interest rate and monthly payment will remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan, unless you choose to refinance your mortgage at a later date for a potentially lower APR. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history, creditworthiness, debt-to-income ratio and the desired loan term. To take out a mortgage, lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more.

The Chiefs are looking to be the first repeat NFL champions since the New England Patriots won back-to-back titles in 2004 and 2005.

      "Is there a streaming lag when watching the Super Bowl?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. When streaming the Super Bowl you should expect to lag behind the action on cable, social media and sports betting apps. Based on previous years, streaming services lag around 40 seconds behind what's on the field. Compare that with cable, satellite or antenna TV, where the time gap from on-field action is significantly smaller.

      "If you're having trouble getting the game after you've turned on your VPN and set it to the correct viewing area, there are two things you can try for a quick fix. First, log into your streaming service subscription account and make sure the address registered for the account is an address in the correct viewing area. If not, you may need to change the physical address on file with your account. Second, some smart TVs -- like Roku -- don't have VPN apps you can install directly on the device itself. Instead, you'll have to install the VPN on your router or the mobile hotspot you're using (like your phone) so that any device on its Wi-Fi network now appears in the correct viewing location.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of the VPN providers we recommend have helpful instructions on their main site for quickly installing the VPN on your router. In some cases with smart TV services, after you install a cable network's sports app, you'll be asked to verify a numeric code or click a link sent to your email address on file for your smart TV. This is where having a VPN on your router will also help since both devices will appear to be in the correct location.\n",

      "He slots into the middle of the Mets' lineup and gives them another power hitter to pair with Pete Alonso. Both can become free agents after this season.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martinez said Alonso was a strong advocate to bring him on board.\n",
      "\n",
      "After waiting all spring to land a job, Martinez said he'll probably need at least 15 days to get ready for the season. So he won't break camp with the Mets in time for Opening Day on Thursday against Milwaukee.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It kind of sucks. Obviously, I want to break with the team. I want to be there. I want to be there for Opening Day. That's a special thing to be a part of,\" Martinez said. \"But I've got to get my body ready. I've got to have my spring training now and I've got to get ready for the season. The last thing I want to do is kind of just rush through it and get hurt. So I want to make sure I take it slow and build my body up to get back out there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To open a roster spot for Martinez, the Mets designated right-hander Phil Bickford for assignment.\n",
      "\n",
      "David Stearns, the team's new president of baseball operations, had insisted the Mets wanted to give youngsters Mark Vientos and Brett Baty plenty of at-bats this season rather than bring in a veteran at DH or third base. But now Martinez becomes the primary DH instead of Vientos, who could still share playing time at third with Baty, getting chances against left-handed pitching in particular.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martinez said he and Vientos have a relationship that goes \"way back\" because they train at the same place. The veteran slugger said he encouraged Vientos not to get discouraged by the apparent loss of playing time because big league opportunities can always arise for talented players -- whether with the Mets or elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I understand his frustration,\" Martinez said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martinez has played the corner outfield spots only sparingly the past two seasons, but he has given every indication he can be a productive DH. Last season was the first time in Dodgers history the team had four players with 100 RBIs, with Martinez joining Mookie Betts, Freddie Freeman and Max Muncy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 33 home runs for Martinez were his most since 2019, and his OPS of .893 represented his highest since that year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martinez began his career with Houston but blossomed after being released by the Astros and picked up by the Tigers in 2014. He hit a career-high 45 homers for Detroit and Arizona in 2017, then joined the Red Sox and hit 43 the following year, when Boston won its most recent World Series title.\n",
      "\n",
      "Martinez was one of the top free agents left on the market. Left-hander Jordan Montgomery, another Scott Boras client, is still looking for a new team in the final days of spring training.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Offseason was kind of a rollercoaster,\" Martinez said. \"There's a lot of really good players out there that are in the same situation.\"\n",

Notably, last year’s championship, which averaged nearly 10 million viewers, introduced the country to Iowa’s Clark and LSU’s Angel Reese.\n",

      "\n",
      "For the uninitiated, capers are the unripened, pea-sized buds of the prickly caper bush, or Capparis spinosa. Let them ripen, and you get caper berries, which are sort of like olives. The caper bush is a hardy shrub, happiest when rooted on a rocky cliff under a hot Mediterranean sun.\n",

      "\n",
      "Once they’re cured and pickled, capers become perfect little salt bombs to drop into a niçoise salad or a chicken piccata. It’s not illegal to order a lox bagel in New York City without capers, but it should be.\n",

      "There is another, more profit-focused theory. It’s courtesy of Jeff Mezzetta, the president of the privately owned California food label Mezzetta (which sells its capers in a variety of jar sizes, all with enough clearance for a regular teaspoon).\n",
      "\n",
      "Skinny jars just look nicer, Mezzetta says.\n",

      "“The taller and the thinner the jar, the more difficult it is to package — because they’re tippy on the production lines, and with the smaller opening, they’re harder to get into the jar,” said Mezzetta, a connoisseur so passionate about the garnish that he even named his dog, a black Labrador, Caper.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Because capers are expensive — and not exactly a staple of the American refrigerator, although sales are rising, according to Mezzetta — food companies opt for smaller jars to keep down the per-unit cost for consumers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zwanka notes a similar packaging dilemma with saffron, one of the world’s most expensive spices. When you buy it at the grocery store, it’s perhaps disheartening to see a few tiny strings packed into the jar for $18.\n",

      "In a country best known for its soaring skyscrapers, modern architecture and sprawling desert, wildlife isn’t always what comes to mind when people think of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). But Dubai-based photographer Anish Karingattil is determined to change that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Originally from India, Karingattil moved to Dubai 17 years ago and began photographing wildlife shortly after, specializing in macro photography, using extreme close ups. Highlights of his stunning portfolio of images, taken across the seven Emirates, include a scorpion with her babies, an Arabian horned viper hiding in the desert sand, and two black and yellow mud daubers covered in dew drops.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Photographers get to tell a story through images,” Karingattil says. “Macro photography allows me to see life and the world around me in a brand-new way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite its hot climate and harsh desert, the UAE is home to over 1,000 plant and animal species. The waters around the country are home to the largest concentration of Indian Ocean humpbacks dolphin in the world, and the second-largest population of dugongs, after Australia.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the UAE’s president recently extending the country’s “Year of Sustainability” into 2024, Karingattil uses wildlife photography as a method of capturing the country’s biodiversity and sharing it with others.\n",
      "\n",
      "While interior design is his full-time job, “herping” is his passion. “Herping is the act of observing, studying, and photographing reptiles and amphibians in their natural habitats,” says Karingattil. “It is a popular hobby among nature enthusiasts and wildlife photographers who are fascinated by the diversity and beauty of these creatures.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Some snakes found in the UAE, including this saw-scaled viper, are aggressive and highly venomous. Anish Karingattil\n",
      "\n",
      "But photographing potentially dangerous animals like snakes and spiders takes a lot of preparation. Before attempting to photograph any wildlife, Karingattil says it is important to research its behavior, habitat and potential risks to understand how to approach it safely and minimize the risk of harm to both the photographer and the animal.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Karingattil, conservation is an important aspect of wildlife photography, which he believes can serve as a powerful tool for advocacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“By documenting the beauty and fragility of the natural world, photographers can help policymakers and the general public understand the value of protecting the environment and the need for sustainable practices,” he says. And with over 69,000 followers on Instagram, Karingattil uses social media to educate people about the species he photographs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Biodiversity in the UAE\n",
      "\n",
      "The UAE has 49 terrestrial and marine protected areas, including eight in Dubai. Accounting for over 18% of the country’s land territory and 12% of its marine and coastal territory, these protected areas are often natural reserves which include all the major ecosystems found in the region: mountain, desert, coastal and marine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Andrew Gardner, associate director of Biodiversity Conservation at Emirates Nature-WWF, says wildlife conservation is recognized as an “important responsibility and obligation by the UAE.” For example, the country is a signatory to multiple international conservation conventions, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity, and has helped reintroduce animals such as the Arabian oryx to the Arabian Peninsula. According to Gardner, there are now over 1,600 oryx in two of the UAE’s protected areas, and thousands more in zoos across the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, rapid development and population growth across the Emirates mean that “53% of bird species, 46.7% of mammal species, 19% of reptile species, and 8% of plant species” are endangered, according to a government report.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was Karingattil's long-term desire to photograph a scorpion, so when he came across this scorpion with her babies, he couldn't let the chance pass by. Anish Karingattil\n",
      "\n",
      "Gardner says the Arabian wolf and striped hyena have both gone extinct from the UAE in recent decades, and a small population of Arabian leopards that lived the Hajar Mountains until the mid-1990s are now also believed to be extinct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Karingattil points to habitat loss, climate change and overfishing as some of the major threats facing wildlife in the UAE, but one issue he thinks people should take more action against is plastic pollution.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Whenever I explore the desert or other areas, I make it a point to clean up the surroundings,” he says. “By removing litter and debris, we can reduce the impact of human activities on the natural world.”\n",

Appleton, about 40 minutes southwest of Green Bay, is one of many airports that broke passenger records last year, and it expects to serve 1 million travelers this year.\n",

      "Financing is coming “from about eight different sources,” said airport Director Abe Weber, including local, state and federal money, bonds and the airport’s own cash.

      "\n",
      "Last month, the White House announced infrastructure law grants totaling $970 million for upgrades at 114 airports intended to “improve passenger experience, accessibility, and sustainability.” The discretionary awards are on top of nearly $2 billion in similar awards made over the past two years under the law’s Airport Terminal Program, a $5 billion fund for competitive grants to support terminal upgrades.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent grants include $35 million to help Washington Dulles International Airport in Northern Virginia construct a 14-gate terminal and transit connections to the Aerotrain and Metrorail. Another grant supplies $26 million to replace Denver International Airport’s baggage handling system.\n",
      "\n",
      "The terminal funding is just one slice of the measure’s five-year, $25 billion pot for modernizing airports nationwide. Within that pool, a separate $5 billion is set aside for improvements to facilities and equipment owned by the Federal Aviation Administration, and $15 billion more is being distributed to airports through a formula based on passenger numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Airports say they need much more.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s a lot of money out there, and Congress has been generous,” said Kevin Burke, president and CEO of the North American airports council, who added that the government’s prioritizing the passenger experience is novel. “But it’s not enough to be able to solve the long-term problem,” he said, “which is enough infrastructure money to be able to modernize all of our airports.”\n",

      "South Carolina’s Myrtle Beach International Airport is using $10 million in federal grants to help build six new gates starting this summer. Gresham Smith\n",
      "\n",
      "In a report last year, the group called for $151 billion to fund “critical” infrastructure improvements over the next five years. Airports typically pay for upgrades with a mélange of rent from airlines and terminal vendors, landing charges tacked on to fliers’ tickets, parking fees and money from various levels of government, as well loans and debt, often in the form of municipal bonds issued by airport authorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new federal infrastructure funds could have an impact broader than the individual projects it’s supporting, some experts said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because airports operate in tandem with one another, improvements at small and midsize ones can help large hubs, too, said Bill Wyatt, executive director of Salt Lake City International Airport. The Utah airport received $20 million in infrastructure law funds toward its $618.7 million building and airfield work tied to the further expansion of a just-built terminal.\n",

      "We may get an extra flight that couldn’t have happened except for the investment of this money. Bill Wyatt, executive director of Salt Lake City International Airport\n",
      "\n",
      "While “it’s great whenever you can find some additional resources,” Wyatt said, a boost to one airport’s operations can be felt across the network, “because suddenly one location now has added capacity, meaning we may get an extra flight that couldn’t have happened except for the investment of this money.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The funding influx may have its biggest impact at smaller airports, where “these grants do play an important role in moving capital programs further and faster,” said Earl Heffintrayer, vice president and senior credit officer at Moody’s Investors Service.\n",
      "\n",
      "South Carolina’s Myrtle Beach International Airport, which serves more than 3 million passengers a year, received $10 million in Airport Terminal Program funds for an $80 million to $90 million expansion that was put on hold during the pandemic but is moving forward now. The 18-month project, which begins in June, will add six gates to the current 12 and revamp restrooms, flooring and signage in the existing terminal.\n",
      "\n",
      "As at other airports, the Myrtle Beach construction is being financed by various sources, including “cost recovery through billing back portions of the project to airlines operating at MYR over the life of the expanded facility,” spokesman Ryan Betcher said. The $10 million grant will allow the airport to reduce the costs it passes on to airlines, help it retain existing flight routes and attract new ones, he said.\n",

      "Philadelphia International Airport is in the midst of a $1.8 billion capital program that includes upgrades to roadways, terminals and the airfield. It secured $74.4 million from the infrastructure package for initiatives that fit the “shovel ready” requirements for funding, Chief Development Officer Api Appulingam said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s not that we wouldn’t have somehow found the funds to do the project,” she said, “but the grants help with the uncertainty in the bidding environment.” Now, if bids come in higher than anticipated, “we’re able to cover the cost, versus trying to find that funding elsewhere” and risk falling behind schedule, Appulingam said.\n",

      "Mark another point against smoking: It may cause an increase in a type of body fat linked to serious disease, according to a new study.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both starting smoking and spending a lifetime smoking cigarettes was associated with an increase in abdominal fat, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Addiction.\n",
      "\n",
      "And further analysis showed that the increase may be in visceral fat, said lead study author Dr. Germán Carrasquilla, an epidemiologist and assistant professor at Karolinska Institute in Sweden.\n",
      "\n",
      "Visceral fat isn’t visible — it surrounds your organs within your abdomen. It’s normal and healthy for visceral fat to make up about 10% of your body’s total fat, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Too much visceral fat, however, can create inflammation, contributing to chronic disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Its location and the way it interacts with our body’s functions make it particularly dangerous,” Carrasquilla said in an email. “This type of fat is strongly linked to heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and other metabolic conditions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The results show the need for large-scale efforts to prevent and reduce smoking, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reducing one major health risk in the population will, indirectly, reduce another major health risk,” Carrasquilla said in a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bad habits travel together\n",
      "\n",
      "The research team conducted a statistical analysis called Mendelian randomization, which uses genetic differences to study how behaviors or environments lead to different health outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“By examining genetic data we can infer whether a relationship is causal, going beyond associations,” Carrasquilla said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The study is well done, and though it provides strong evidence that smoking and increased abdominal fat have a causal, not just correlational, relationship, it is not quite definitive, said Naveed Sattar, professor of cardiometabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. He was not involved in the research.\n",
      "\n",
      "There could be some confounding elements that make the link between smoking and belly fat stronger, added Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bad habits also tend to travel together,” said Freeman, who was not involved in the research. For example, people may reach for a pack of cigarettes when stressed or may be smoking alongside a beer, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you ready to quit?\n",
      "\n",
      "One big question that remains is whether stopping smoking can reverse the development of abdominal fat, Carrasquilla said.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that does not mean that smokers should hesitate to start their journey to quitting, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We all know that smoking is bad,” he said. “Public health interventions should continue to emphasize the overall health improvements associated with smoking cessation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Even outside of cigarettes, breathing in substances — such as marijuana, air pollution and cooking smoke — has been associated with an increase in cardiovascular and lung disease, Freeman added.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Any inhaled substance is bad news,” he said. “Getting rid of it is always a plus.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Quitting smoking is famously hard, however.\n",
      "\n",
      "Freeman recommends his patients utilize support programs such as the helpline 1-800-QUIT-NOW and find ways to remove the temptation, particularly if you have loved ones who smoke as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you have a significant other in the household or another person in the household who smokes, it’s going to be really hard to quit smoking,” he said. “I always tell people, if you have friends that smoke and you’re trying to quit, tell them you’ll see them in a few months — as awful as that sounds.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It can also be helpful to find new ways of coping with stress, since that is often a big trigger driving people to smoke, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exercise is not only a good stress reducer but has also been shown to be a potent aid in quitting smoking, Freeman added.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Getting in 30 minutes a day of good breathless activity is really important,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "However you approach quitting, the first step is to get to the place where you are ready and eager to rid yourself of the habit, Freeman said. That could be a desire to be stronger, healthier or even just to save money.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you’re not ready to quit smoking, I could cover you head to toe in patches and give you your body-weight drugs to help you quit smoking and you’re not going to quit,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you want to be Grandpa Joe or Grandma Jean who is suffering the ills of cardiovascular disease that would have been progressed by cigarette smoking and having a miserable time in old age, or do you want to be dancing with your great-grandchildren?” Freeman said. “That’s really the motivating factor.”\n",

      "In a country best known for its soaring skyscrapers, modern architecture and sprawling desert, wildlife isn’t always what comes to mind when people think of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). But Dubai-based photographer Anish Karingattil is determined to change that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Originally from India, Karingattil moved to Dubai 17 years ago and began photographing wildlife shortly after, specializing in macro photography, using extreme close ups. Highlights of his stunning portfolio of images, taken across the seven Emirates, include a scorpion with her babies, an Arabian horned viper hiding in the desert sand, and two black and yellow mud daubers covered in dew drops.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Photographers get to tell a story through images,” Karingattil says. “Macro photography allows me to see life and the world around me in a brand-new way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite its hot climate and harsh desert, the UAE is home to over 1,000 plant and animal species. The waters around the country are home to the largest concentration of Indian Ocean humpbacks dolphin in the world, and the second-largest population of dugongs, after Australia.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the UAE’s president recently extending the country’s “Year of Sustainability” into 2024, Karingattil uses wildlife photography as a method of capturing the country’s biodiversity and sharing it with others.\n",
      "\n",
      "While interior design is his full-time job, “herping” is his passion. “Herping is the act of observing, studying, and photographing reptiles and amphibians in their natural habitats,” says Karingattil. “It is a popular hobby among nature enthusiasts and wildlife photographers who are fascinated by the diversity and beauty of these creatures.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Some snakes found in the UAE, including this saw-scaled viper, are aggressive and highly venomous. Anish Karingattil\n",
      "\n",
      "But photographing potentially dangerous animals like snakes and spiders takes a lot of preparation. Before attempting to photograph any wildlife, Karingattil says it is important to research its behavior, habitat and potential risks to understand how to approach it safely and minimize the risk of harm to both the photographer and the animal.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Karingattil, conservation is an important aspect of wildlife photography, which he believes can serve as a powerful tool for advocacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“By documenting the beauty and fragility of the natural world, photographers can help policymakers and the general public understand the value of protecting the environment and the need for sustainable practices,” he says. And with over 69,000 followers on Instagram, Karingattil uses social media to educate people about the species he photographs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Biodiversity in the UAE\n",
      "\n",
      "The UAE has 49 terrestrial and marine protected areas, including eight in Dubai. Accounting for over 18% of the country’s land territory and 12% of its marine and coastal territory, these protected areas are often natural reserves which include all the major ecosystems found in the region: mountain, desert, coastal and marine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Andrew Gardner, associate director of Biodiversity Conservation at Emirates Nature-WWF, says wildlife conservation is recognized as an “important responsibility and obligation by the UAE.” For example, the country is a signatory to multiple international conservation conventions, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity, and has helped reintroduce animals such as the Arabian oryx to the Arabian Peninsula. According to Gardner, there are now over 1,600 oryx in two of the UAE’s protected areas, and thousands more in zoos across the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, rapid development and population growth across the Emirates mean that “53% of bird species, 46.7% of mammal species, 19% of reptile species, and 8% of plant species” are endangered, according to a government report.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was Karingattil's long-term desire to photograph a scorpion, so when he came across this scorpion with her babies, he couldn't let the chance pass by. Anish Karingattil\n",
      "\n",
      "Gardner says the Arabian wolf and striped hyena have both gone extinct from the UAE in recent decades, and a small population of Arabian leopards that lived the Hajar Mountains until the mid-1990s are now also believed to be extinct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Karingattil points to habitat loss, climate change and overfishing as some of the major threats facing wildlife in the UAE, but one issue he thinks people should take more action against is plastic pollution.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Whenever I explore the desert or other areas, I make it a point to clean up the surroundings,” he says. “By removing litter and debris, we can reduce the impact of human activities on the natural world.”\n",

      "FAQs What is a personal loan? A personal loan is a type of installment credit that allows borrowers to receive a one-time lump sum of cash. Borrowers must then pay back that amount plus interest in regular, monthly installments over the loan's term. How do you apply for a personal loan? When applying for a personal loan, you'll need to provide some basic pieces of information, which can include your address, social security number and date of birth, among others. You may also be required to submit pay stubs as proof of income. Some lenders may also require your bank account information. An application can typically be submitted online or in person if the lender has physical branches that you can visit. How do you get a personal loan with bad credit? Some lenders offer personal loans that cater to borrowers with lower credit scores, and may allow borrowers with bad credit to apply with co-borrowers. It's always advised to try to improve your credit score before applying for any form of credit since it can be difficult to qualify with lower credit scores. Additionally, lower credit scores tend to be subject to higher interest rates. What is an unsecured personal loan? An unsecured loan is a form of credit that doesn't require you to put up collateral that can be used to settle your balance if you default on the loan. Most personal loans are unsecured loans.\n",

When narrowing down and ranking the best personal loans for fair or good credit, we focused on the following features: Fixed-rate APR: Variable rates can go up and down over the lifetime of your loan.

      "The nation’s largest credit union said this week that an external review found it hadn’t considered race in mortgage underwriting, responding to CNN’s previous reporting about racial gaps in its mortgage approval rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Navy Federal Credit Union, which has more than 13 million members and lends to military servicemembers, Department of Defense personnel, veterans and their families, said a review it commissioned from a civil rights lawyer “found no race-based decision making in our mortgage underwriting” and that “legitimate, non-race factors” had largely explained racial differences in approval rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "A CNN investigation published in December found that Navy Federal approved more than 75% of the White borrowers who applied for a new conventional home purchase mortgage in 2022 while approving less than 50% of Black borrowers who applied for the same type of loan, according to the most recent federal data available from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nearly 29-percentage-point gap in Navy Federal’s approval rates was the widest of any of the 50 lenders that originated the most mortgage loans in 2022. The disparity remained even after accounting for more than a dozen different variables available in public mortgage data, including applicants’ income, debt-to-income ratio and property value, CNN’s review found.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, an analysis by staff of the Senate Banking Committee, which 10 Democratic senators cited in a letter asking federal regulators to review Navy Federal’s mortgage lending earlier this year, also found racial disparities in Navy Federal’s mortgage approval rates based on the publicly available data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Navy Federal said Thursday that an analysis it had commissioned by lawyer Debo Adegbile, a former member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, found that those racial disparities were largely accounted for by examining “all non-public underwriting factors.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our review found that when all relevant factors are controlled for, which CNN did not do, the difference in approval rates between Black and White borrowers falls to less than 1%,” Adegbile said in a statement. “The remaining difference in approval rates is explained by legitimate, non-race factors like income verification and incomplete credit applications.” The analysis also accounted for other non-public factors including applicants’ credit scores, the statement said.\n",
      "\n",
      "A spokesperson for Navy Federal did not respond to a request for additional details about the analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "As CNN previously reported, applicants’ credit scores are not available in the public mortgage data, and Navy Federal declined to provide CNN any data that would make it possible to analyze credit scores or other non-public factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "CNN’s analysis only included mortgage applications that were listed in the public data as being fully submitted and either approved or denied, and excluded those that were listed as “closed for incompleteness.” And while Navy Federal’s statement said its analysis included applicants’ debt-to-income ratios, CNN’s review also took those ratios, which are available in the public mortgage data, into account.\n",
      "\n",
      "Navy Federal described Adegbile’s analysis as an “external review,” but his law firm, WilmerHale, is also defending Navy Federal in a class-action lawsuit from Black and Latino borrowers who allege the credit union discriminated against them in mortgage applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same day that Navy Federal released a statement about the review, other lawyers from WilmerHale filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which had cited CNN’s reporting. Attorneys for the credit union argued that the “alleged statistical disparities” the plaintiffs had cited were not sufficient to prove discrimination, and that they “fail to identify any Navy Federal policy or practice that caused any disparity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The lawyers also argued that agreements the plaintiffs had signed when they became members of the credit union had required them to give Navy Federal adequate notice before filing a lawsuit, and that most had not done so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adegbile’s analysis was not included in Navy Federal’s motion to dismiss the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plaintiffs’ attorneys – Ben Crump, Adam Levitt, and Hassan Zavareei – said in a statement that it was “a classic conflict of interest” for Adegbile to review Navy Federal’s practices at the same time his firm was defending the credit union in court.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Navy Federal should immediately put out the full investigative report and data analysis so that Navy Federal’s members have an opportunity for themselves to review the findings,” the statement said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In its statement, Navy Federal also said it was “currently examining initiatives to build on our mission of expanding access to credit for our diverse community of members and continue our efforts to address systemic barriers to homeownership.”\n",

      "Director Jonathan Glazer’s acclaimed movie “The Zone of Interest” recently won two Oscars — for best international feature film and for sound. Steven Spielberg has declared it to be the best Holocaust film since his own “Schindler’s List” came out in 1993.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Rutland Courtesy Olivia Drake\n",
      "\n",
      "In his Oscar acceptance speech, Glazer, who is himself Jewish, invoked the Holocaust to criticize Israel’s military actions in Gaza. His speech drew some praise but also criticism from the Jewish community — including from the movie’s executive producer, Danny Cohen.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in some important respects, the film is even more troubling than Glazer’s speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "The film documents the mundane life of the family of Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Höss (played by Christian Friedel) and his wife, Hedwig (Sandra Hüller), while the atrocities themselves are kept out of sight behind the concentration camp wall. It was inspired by the 2014 novel “The Zone of Interest” by Martin Amis, the enfant terrible of English letters whose works use satire as a vehicle for reveling in money, sex and power.\n",
      "\n",
      "What the satiric movie “Saltburn” does for the English upper class, “The Zone of Interest” is doing for National Socialism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Director Jonathan Glazer's speech at the Oscars on March 10 has drawn some praise as well as criticism. Frank Micelotta/Disney/Getty Images\n",
      "\n",
      "While the evil of Nazism is an abstraction in the movie, out of sight and out of mind, viewers are invited to identify with the daily life of the family Höss. The lush images of the film convey an idyllic family life, with an immaculately clean house and bountiful garden. The Nazis loved their children and their pets. They played the piano.\n",
      "\n",
      "Glazer has explained that his goal was to show that the perpetrators of the Holocaust were not monsters but humans, just like us. It could have happened anywhere: to anyone, by anyone. Viewers are invited to consider that as we go about our mundane lives, evil is taking place somewhere behind a wall, which we chose not to look over.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the whole idea of making a Nazi pastoral film is historically misleading and frankly offensive. As Israeli film critic Avner Shavit has pointed out, Glazer has managed to make a film about the Holocaust in which we never see any Jews.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sandra Hüller portrays Hedwig Höss in “The Zone of Interest,” which won the Oscar for best international feature film. Courtesy of A24\n",
      "\n",
      "Likewise, in a 45-minute discussion of the film by the cast and crew at the Cannes Film Festival in May, the question of Jews never came up. Instead, producer James Wilson talked about how white racism and colonialism were driven by beliefs “that were very similar to the ideas that were propagated by National Socialism in the 1930s.” An audience member saw connections to the “Don’t say gay” law in Florida.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Holocaust happened to the Jews, at the hands of the Nazis and their collaborators, and its specificity should not be diluted into a general meditation on the banality of evil.\n",
      "\n",
      "The movie’s conceit is not a particularly clever or original take on history. The fact that the guards had happy moments during their time at the camp was vividly revealed by the photo album of deputy commander Karl-Friedrich Höcker that was donated to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in 2007.\n",
      "\n",
      "Glazer is echoing elements of the “banality of evil” argument laid out in Hannah Arendt’s “Eichmann in Jerusalem.” In his 1961 trial, Adolf Eichmann’s defense was that he was just a bureaucrat carrying out orders. But Arendt was wrong. Due to the release of long-hidden tapes that started to become available in the 2010s that the Nazi official made while in exile in Argentina, we now know that Eichman, the chief logistics officer of the Holocaust, was an ideological zealot deeply committed to National Socialism.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some time scholars have studied “banal nationalism”: the expression of national identity in everyday life. But there was nothing banal about the Holocaust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, the film implies that Höss was just doing his job. But Höss was not just a bored bureaucrat and family man. He was a fanatical Nazi who had joined the party in 1922 and was sent to jail for participating in a political assassination the following year.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Zone of Interest” is rather tedious as a film. It barely has a plot, and the conversations and daily routines are repetitious. Several scenes will leave viewers confused, such as the one where Höss finds a jawbone while fishing in the river and drags his kids out of the water.

      "Likewise, the local girl going out at night to leave food for the camp inmates (based on a true story) will have mystified most of the audience. The scene will have pleased the Polish authorities who helped to produce the film, since it portrays the Poles as helping the Jews. Yes, some Poles did heroically help Jews. But some joined in pogroms, or betrayed Jews in hiding to the Germans. These grim facts have been documented by historian Jan Gross, provoking intense controversy in Poland. No sign of that in this film.\n",

      "There is a long history of fascination with the aesthetics of the Third Reich, as in the films of Leni Riefenstahl. Back in 1975, Susan Sontag wrote a perceptive essay condemning the fetishization of Nazi paraphernalia. “The Zone of Interest” will certainly appeal to those who admire the aesthetics of Nazism: the striking uniforms, the distinctive “fashy” (short for fascist) haircuts, the nice animals.

Its V2L adapter allows the parked EV6 to output around 1.6 kilowatts via a standard AC outlet (NEMA 5-15) to power a campsite, a tailgate party or more. With the aid of an extension cord, it can keep your refrigerator and a few appliances running so your food doesn't spoil. You could even charge another EV -- albeit very slowly -- in an emergency.

      "Factors to consider before buying an electric SUV\n",
      "\n",
      "Cargo and passenger capacity: The biggest advantage that an electric SUV has over a sedan or hatchback is capacity for people and cargo. Your needs in this respect will dictate how large an SUV you need, how many rows of seats you should look for and -- to an extent -- whether electric is even right for you in the first place. Of course, some SUVs built from the ground up with electrification in their DNA may also feature a second front trunk (or frunk) under the hood where the gasoline engine traditionally sits, giving them even more cargo flexibility versus their combustion-powered contemporaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Range and towing: How far an electric car can go on a single charge is usually the first number that shoppers check when considering an electric vehicle. Longer range means fewer stops on long trips and more peace of mind between charging stations on the road. However, SUV owners are much more likely to also use their vehicles for towing, which can reduce an EV's advertised range significantly. (The same could be said for towing with combustion cars, but the squeeze is more obvious with EVs given their shorter cruising range and longer refueling times.) When shopping for an electric SUV, consider what and how much you'll need to tow and leave plenty of wiggle room in your range estimates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Efficiency: SUVs are heavy and, typically, less fuel efficient than smaller sedans, hatchback and some vans. The same goes for electric SUVs, with their big heavy batteries. The Tesla Model Y is a thrifty eSUV, but it chugs 13% more electricity than the most efficient electric sedan. (At 123 mpge, the Tesla is still miles ahead of a similarly sized combustion or hybrid-powered SUV.) Keep an eye on the EPA estimated efficiency when comparing electric SUVs; with this number and your local energy rates, you can easily calculate how much it costs to operate an EV and how much you could potentially save compared with a conventional combustion car.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charging: For long road trips, an EV's DC fast charging experience can have an even larger impact on EV ownership than its range. Electric SUVs tend to have larger batteries to compensate for their large chassis, which means they tend to take longer to fill their bucket of electricity even with very fast charging speeds. Most plug-in SUVs I recommend can DC fast charge to 80% -- the recommended capacity to optimize charging speeds -- in 20 to 30 minutes, covering at least 200 miles between stops. You'll also want to consider what EV charging networks (Tesla Superchargers, Electrify America, Rivian's Adventure Network and others) cover your most-beaten paths.\n",
      "\n",
      "Features: An electric car is more than just a battery, motors and a charging port. It's also a car, which means it needs to be a good car that meets your needs for cabin technology, safety and driver aid technologies, and style. For electric SUVs that encourage active lifestyles, features like bidirectional charging may become even more important, allowing owners to draw power from an EV's battery pack to power accessories, electric bikes and even appliances at a trailhead, work site or tailgate party.\n",

      "How we test electric SUVs\n",
      "\n",
      "Simply put, I test electric SUVs the same way I've tested nearly every EV model sold in the US over the last 15 years: I drive them. The process always starts behind the wheel in real-world conditions on public roads. For each SUV I test, I cover over 200 miles behind the wheel on a mixed driving route that includes dense urban streets (complete with potholes), long stretches of highway and twisty mountain roads. Most electric SUVs aren't really built for serious off-roading, but I make sure that the ones that are -- such as the Rivian R1S -- tackle a trail or two along the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "My long test route allows me to also check the DC fast charging speed and to compare my first-hand tested range and efficiency with estimates reported by the US EPA, both to double-check the official numbers against the real world and to make sure my experiences represent those of the typical American driver. As always, of course, your mileage may vary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Along the way, I also check each SUV's cabin comfort, dashboard tech and driver aid features to get a feel for where each vehicle stacks up against the hundreds of combustion-, hybrid-, hydrogen- and battery-powered SUVs I've reviewed during my tenure with for CNET reviews.\n",

      "\n",
      "Volkswagen's ID.4 is an unflashy but solid alternative to the Tesla Model Y. It boasts a good amount of range for running errands and daily driving; it's got good and peppy performance and is more spacious than many other electric SUVs in its class. Its exterior design doesn't draw a whole lot of attention to its \"EV-ness,\" which is nice. However, awkward dashboard touch controls and strange ergonomic design decisions -- such as the omission of rear window switches on the back doors -- kept it from clicking with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mercedes-Benz's EQE SUV checks a whole lot of the right boxes. Luxurious and spacious without being too large and loud? Check. Healthy reservoir of range? At around 270 miles, check. Its clever electric all-wheel drive system is even reasonably efficient. About the only con I can think of is that US models don't seem to be available with Benz's triple-display, full-width Hyperscreen, but that may actually be a good thing. (The Hyperscreen makes a splashy first impression, but I don't think it adds much in terms of actual useful functionality over the standard and still massive screen.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Audi's Q8 E-Tron and BMW's iX are also excellent electric SUVs in their own right with premium cabin materials and solid electric performance, range and charging speeds. There's a bit of a learning curve to BMW's iDrive infotainment, but once set up, it's one of the best and most flexible cabin tech suites in its class. Meanwhile, the Audi is noteworthy for being one of the only EVs I've seen available with two charging ports (one on each front fender), so you'll almost never run into a too-short-charging-cable situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "FAQs\n",
      "\n",
      "How much range should I look for in an electric SUV? How much range you'll need from an EV will vary depending on your individual needs and driving habits. For most drivers with an average American commute -- around 55.2 miles according to the most recent US Census Bureau data -- an EV SUV in the 200- to 300-mile ballpark should provide adequate range for daily driving, unexpected errands and the occasional road trip. Keep in mind that towing, icy and snowy weather or extreme heat can sap as much as 41% of EV's stated range in the most extreme cases, so consider a more generous estimate if these conditions apply to you. Check these tips to decide how much range you should target when buying an electric car.\n",
      "\n",
      "How long does it take to charge an electric SUV? The amount of time it takes to charge an electric car will depend on the power output by the charging hardware and the size of the EV's battery pack. And because the largest electric SUVs tend to have larger batteries, they could take longer to charge than smaller, lighter EVs. Broadly, there are three levels of EV charging that you need to know: DC fast charging is the fastest charging method used by public charging networks, getting you from 10% to 80% on average in 30 to 60 minutes. Level 2 (240-volt) home or public stations recharge a day's worth of driving with an overnight session. Level 1 chargers -- which plug into the familiar NEMA 5-15 home outlet, the same one your TV or laptop uses -- and can take well over 24 hours to trickle charge an SUV, making this method a last expedient when there are no other options.\n",
      "\n",
      "Are electric SUVs more expensive than gas-powered SUVs? Within the same class, yes, electric SUVs tend to be more expensive than their combustion-powered cousins due to the rare and costly materials that make up their large battery packs. For now, prospective buyers will want to look to any available federal and state tax incentives or rebates to offset the cost, while also weighing potential operating cost benefits of going electric. Today's most efficient gas-powered SUV, Toyota's Venza, sips fuel at 39 mpg thanks to hybridization, but most electric SUVs average well over 100 mpge while using less expensive electricity. That can make them less expensive to operate, potentially saving money over the long term.\n",

      "An incisive expression of family and culture that neither apologizes nor over-explains itself, Roshan Sethi's A Nice Indian Boy is a riotous, moving queer romantic comedy with a wildly unique premise. While it resembles many modern third-culture stories — specifically, tales of disconnect between first-generation South Asians in the West and their immigrant parents — it widens its scope in surprising ways that reflect and refract both personal and cinematic identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking inspiration from a romantic Bollywood classic, the film follows a gay Indian American doctor whose parents are nominally accepting, but who want him to find \"a nice Indian boy.\" Long story short: He does! The immediate wrinkle, however, is that this nice Indian boy is none other than Jonathan Groff — yes, Hamilton's original King George — playing a white man raised by Indian parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "On one hand, A Nice Indian Boy is the tale of a typical Indian American family, with typical Indian American problems — a generational disconnect, gendered double standards, and a culture of awkward silence around sexuality — but on the other hand, its evolution into grand romantic saga is anything but typical. It's also a story of cross-cultural adoption that dovetails into not only a hilariously awkward meet-the-parents comedy, but also a film about freeing oneself from emotional and generational baggage, in a way that yields tears of joy and laughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is A Nice Indian Boy about?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Naveen Gavaskar (Deadpool's Karan Soni) is the kind of realistic queer protagonist seldom seen in Hollywood: an introverted gay man who'd rather be at home than at the club — or in the case of the movie's opening scene, at his sister's colorful wedding reception. As the guests dance to thumping tunes, and the camera tilts and spins to capture them, Naveen sits still, fending off over-enthusiastic family members whose words of marital encouragement sound more like a dire warning: \"You're next!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "What Naveen's nosy aunties and uncles don't know, and what his parents begrudgingly accept, is that his wedding won't quite look like a Hindi movie, since he happens to be into guys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Six years go by — notably, the amount of time between Sethi coming out and the film's premiere — and Naveen's life away from his parents is somewhat content, even though it involves lonely nights of leaving exes and crushes some uncomfortably awkward voice messages. He has absolutely no game, despite the efforts of his outgoing gay colleague Paul (Peter S. Kim) to bring him out of his shell. But the gods eventually smile on him when he comes across an attractive white photographer, Jay Kurundkar (Groff), at his local mandir (or temple) while praying to a statue of Ganesh, the elephant-headed Hindu god of wisdom and good luck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two things immediately stand out about Jay: his tranquil charm, and his authentic pronunciation of \"Ganesh\" — with an extended \"e\" as in \"lace,\" rather than the protracted \"e\" of words like \"less,\" to which most Westerners default. Naveen is immediately flustered by Jay's confident stares, but agrees to accompany him on a date to his favorite movie, which, to the good doctor's surprise, turns out to be Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (or DDLJ), the iconic 1995 Bollywood romance about two star-crossed Indian Londoners, whose musical centerpiece features superstar Shah Rukh Khan serenading actress Kajol in a field of yellow mustard flowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "But instead of being bowled over by this gesture, Naveen finds himself unable to fully embrace the film or Jay's off-key crooning of its famous track, \" Tujhe Dekha To \" (yes, Groff sings it himself, with barely a syllable out of place). Sincerity and vulnerability remain obstacles to Naveen, even after he and Jay start dating. This proves mildly problematic when meeting each other's friends, but it's downright disastrous when the question of Jay meeting Naveen's parents arises, given how little he's told them about his white, freelance photographer boyfriend who vapes and waxes poetic about Hindi cinema.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results are as side-splitting as they are disheartening, because the one lesson A Nice Indian Boy takes from DDLJ is that Indian romantic films are family dramas too. However, what initially seems hopeless ends up an exciting challenge, because Jay has also internalized this lesson. And, like Shah Rukh Khan's brash Raj Malhotra, he'll stop at nothing to win over the parents of the person he loves.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Nice Indian Boy is also a family drama.\n",
      "\n",
      "The film, written by Eric Randall, is based on the play by Madhuri Shekar, and it has the structure of a five-act play, with each section broken up by significant time jumps. This ends up serving a dual purpose. On one hand, this shifts the typical feel-good rom-com climax to the middle of the story, away from its usual place in most three-act Hollywood screenplays, where it serves as a resolution. In the process, A Nice Indian Boy allows for the realities of long-term romance and wedding planning to creep in through the corners of the frame, beyond the broad declarations of love.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, it also allows each member of Naveen's family to have their own dedicated section of the movie, during which they become a primary character. Like Naveen, his sister Arundhathi (Sunita Mani) harbors a grudge against their parents for the choices she did and didn't have while growing up, including in matters of love, and she sees their increased leeway with Naveen as a matter of grave injustice. Meanwhile, their outspoken mother Megha (Zarna Garg) tries to smooth things over with both children, but since she's just as hot-headed as her daughter, it's easier said than done. In terms of temperament, Naveen takes after his father Archit (Harish Patel), though his silent acceptance of Naveen's sexuality — while avoiding eye contact at all cost — hurts more than outright disapproval. Like his son, Archit has a problem with expressing himself honestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Megha and Archit's genuine attempts to bridge the gap between themselves and Naveen also leads to some uproarious overcompensation, between the topics they bring up in Jay's presence without any filter whatsoever, to their sincere attempts to educate themselves by binging raunchy reality shows on OutTV and bringing them up in conversation. It's incredibly funny and incredibly sweet, but none of these superficial gestures — no matter how well-meaning — are a substitute for the real emotional work the Gavaskar family needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The film doesn't let Naveen off the hook either, whether it comes to his avoidance of intimacy or the walls he keeps up between him and his family members. Those walls only start to come down after some rigorous and difficult dramatic moments, which Sethi directs with incredible command.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Nice Indian Boy is brilliantly directed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The film's premise resembles a number of third-culture films and shows featuring South Asians in the West, like The Big Sick, Ms. Marvel, and Blinded by the Light. These stories of artistically driven first-gen kids and their immigrant parents who \"just don't understand\" have settled into a rote rhythm in recent years. A fellow SXSW selection, the lukewarm The Queen of My Dreams , is a key example: a similarly Bollywood-inspired tale of a queer Pakistani Canadian who nominally reconciles with her conservative mother. It's rarely a good sign when you can map out the beats of a story based on its cultural premise, but A Nice Indian Boy finds numerous visual and thematic ways to buck that trend.\n",
      "\n",
      "It stands out, first and foremost, through its bustling visual energy, which not only captures the chaos and excitement constantly unfolding around Naveen — at weddings, family meetings, or parties hosted by Jay's outgoing friends — but also serves to magnify his glum stillness as the camera pushes in and pulls out prominently during both comedy beats and charged emotional moments. The film's comedy and drama stem from the same place: the tension of expectations, whether it involves Naveen wrestling with his prescribed role as an Indian man in the West; the implications of his queerness, according to his parents; or how Jay will fit into the Gavaskars' family dynamic.\n",
      "\n",
      "What Jay yearns for, as a perpetual outsider who found love in an Indian household once before, is just as vital to the movie as Naveen's search for emotional authenticity. And when the film begins drawing more overtly from Bollywood iconography, it weaves together its grandiose romance from both their perspectives. To Jay, Hindi cinema is the ultimate expression of love and acceptance. To Naveen, it's a cheesy façade. The truth, it turns out, may lie somewhere in between, with Sethi presenting the story's key turning points as stylistic handshakes between formal grandeur and naturalistic, self-aware comedy, without compromising either character’s point of view. The movie's sweeping declarations are as bold and unapologetic as they are goofy and silly, so they end up running the emotional gamut.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rarely has a rom-com been this simultaneously hysterical and touching, though despite its boisterous tone, its biggest strength may very well be its silent moments. The father-son pairing of Naveen and Archit tend to find solace in silence, and that isn't likely to change anytime soon. So, in order to draw them out of their comfort zones, A Nice Indian Boy becomes a film about gestures both big and small. Its most heartrending moments arrive in the form of these two men — separated by generational disconnect, but bound by common cultural expectations — adapting to other people's modes of expression in the small ways they're able to. Over the course of the film, they learn to speak other people's love languages, leading to rousing, overwhelming moments (some of them in delightful musical form).\n",

      "Former Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel on Sunday called the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol “unacceptable” after years of deflecting on the issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "McDaniel, who is joining NBC News as a political analyst after exiting the RNC earlier this month, told the outlet that the Capitol riot “doesn’t represent our country. It certainly does not represent my party.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We should not be attacking the Capitol; we should not be having violence,” she added. Asked why she didn’t offer such condemnation as RNC chairwoman, McDaniel responded, “When you’re the RNC chair, you kind of take one for the whole team. Right now, I get to be a little bit more myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "McDaniel’s RNC exit comes amid a period of rising tensions between Donald Trump, the GOP presidential front-runner, and the RNC. Trump and his team had been disappointed with the RNC’s finances, with the committee experiencing one of its most anemic years of fundraising in the last decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "The former president had also believed that the RNC under McDaniel’s leadership should have done more to fight for his candidacy in the 2020 election, including retaining better lawyers to push the former president’s false claims of rampant voter fraud.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump, McDaniel said Sunday, “absolutely wanted me to move aside and wanted Michael Whatley and Lara Trump to come in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "McDaniel said that while her role required her to remain neutral regarding GOP candidates, tensions rose with the Trump campaign when the former president decided to forgo this cycle’s primary debates.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We had debates, and there was tension and a little friction that started during that process. It was well played out in the media,” McDaniel said. “And I knew at that point, when I was doing that role, and we were going to have debates, that when the nominee came forward, and it was likely to be President Trump, that they were going to switch and that’s his right as nominee.”\n",
      "\n",
      "News of McDaniel’s hiring at NBC has drawn sharp backlash. She has a long history of assailing the news media as “fake” and her promotion of false claims around the 2020 elections.\n",
      "\n",
      "As RNC chair, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel told the officials, regarding the certification: “Do not sign it. … We will get you attorneys.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Michigan Department of State’s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had “no merit.” The state’s “elections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,” it said in a detailed fact check posted online.\n",
      "\n",
      "McDaniel acknowledged Sunday that Biden won the 2020 election “fair and square” even as she voiced concern over “issues” with the vote. “I believe that both can be true,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Asked about the criticism of her RNC tenure, and the blame some have placed on her for a slate of Republican losses, McDaniel said, “I push back on that very hard.”\n",

      "\n",
      "The Russian Embassy in Washington says it did not receive any warnings about a potential terror attack in Moscow from the US, Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov told Russian state news agency RIA Novosti on Sunday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The US diplomatic mission had warned Americans to “avoid large gatherings” at the beginning of March due to reports “that extremists have imminent plans to target large gatherings in Moscow.”\n",

      "Cast iron pans are fantastic for searing meat\n",
      "\n",
      "Cast iron pans usually get shout-outs from professional chefs who treat them like their most prized possession. But is all the hype really justified?\n",
      "\n",
      "Restaurateur Tim Hayward admits he used to have a full range of cast iron pans, but now he's cut it down to just one that he uses for searing to get that beautiful crust. He explains that cast iron pans have “thermal mass… it's got a lot of ‘stuff’ in it to take the heat, hold the heat and move it around.” In other words, the heavy base evenly disperses the heat once it gets up to temperature. Of course, that heavy base can also put off home cooks who don't want to tote a massive iron slab around after a long day’s work.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's also a lot of mythologising around seasoning cast iron pans, with some cooks claiming it's destructive to wash a cast iron pan out. There is some truth to this – coating the cast iron pan with seasoning and oils helps to create a non-stick effect that prevents meat from clinging and burning in the pan. Since Tim only uses his cast iron for searing, he's often happy to just wipe it out with a piece of paper towel and hang it back up on the hook. For home cooks who are squeamish about hygiene, there's no need to worry – you can definitely clean a cast iron pan with soap without any ill effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stainless-steel pans are the all-purpose workhorses of the kitchen\n",
      "\n",
      "Given how unwieldy a cast iron pan can be, stainless-steel pans are often preferred for everyday cooking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tim uses a deeper stainless-steel pan so he can toss the contents more easily and even boil or steam food in it. Stainless-steel pans have the same heavy base of a cast iron pan to get that heat-dispersal effect, but unfortunately will take much longer to get up to temperature.\n",
      "\n",
      "The real reason stainless steel is such a great material is in the name – you have to go some to tarnish it. That means stainless steel pans don't need a coating! But just be careful, as this rule only applies to stainless-steel products from reputable brands. A cheaper brand will leach nickel and chromium into your food over time, which can have mild negative effects on your health.\n",
      "\n",
      "For that reason, Greg advises that it's best to avoid cleaning stainless steel with vinegar or using metal scourers that will create scratches in the smooth surface. Keep it simple by just using soap and water!\n",
      "\n",
      "Anodised metal pans protect your food and keep cookware light\n",
      "\n",
      "There are plenty of metal pans that are great for heating, but they require special treatment to keep them protected. The most common are anodised aluminium pans, a lightweight piece of cookware that heats up quick, feels light and costs far less than many of the other options.\n",
      "\n",
      "The premium option, however, is anodised titanium – the Rolls-Royce of cookware materials. Anodised titanium pans have all the benefits of cast iron cookware, but with just one-third of the weight.\n",
      "\n",
      "What does ‘anodised’ actually mean though? Essentially, anodised metals have had an electric current passed over them to produce an oxide layer that acts as the pan's coating. Aluminium pans, for example, have an anodised aluminium oxide layer that protects them from reacting with strongly acidic or alkaline foods.\n",

      "The German Football Association (DFB) announced Thursday that the company’s arch rival Nike (NKE) will be the official kit supplier for national soccer teams from 2027 until 2﻿034. The decision brings to an abrupt end more than seven decades of the sport’s partnership with Adidas that spanned four World Cup wins for the men’s team.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The rule is part of a larger set of Biden administration regulations being released starting this week, after intense discussions with automakers who have said they could not meet initial proposals for a much more aggressive EV transition. Those proposals called for much stricter emission standards with the goal of pushing EV market share to 67% of all new cars sold by 2032 from less than 8% last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Department of Energy decision, first reported by Reuters on Monday, significantly slows the phase-out of existing rules that give automakers extra fuel-economy credit for electric vehicles they currently sell. The real-world impact of the complex regulations has been to help U.S. automakers meet federal standards for fleetwide fuel efficiency while they continue selling highly profitable gasoline-powered pickups and SUVs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Biden administration on Tuesday handed Detroit automakers a major win by easing proposed rules that would have forced them to scale back production of gas-guzzling vehicles or face billions of dollars in fines.\n",
      "\n",
      "President Joe Biden's retreat on the aggressive EV push comes as his 2024 re-election campaign faces a potential must-win scenario in the battleground state of Michigan, the hub of the U.S. auto industry and much of its unionized workforce. His Republican opponent, Donald Trump, has charged that Biden's policies will kill auto jobs and aid China's surging electric-vehicle industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Environmentalists have long criticized the Energy Department rules for assigning unrealistically high fuel-economy values to electric vehicles, which are then figured in to fleetwide averages under federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) rules. The higher figures assigned to EVs help offset the values of gas-guzzling vehicles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current rules, for instance, credit the Ford F-150 Lightning electric pickup as getting the equivalent of 237.7 miles per gallon (mpg). The administration's original proposal last year would have reduced that to 67.1 mpg, a more realistic estimate of its real-world efficiency compared with a gasoline-powered F-150.\n",
      "\n",
      "The original Biden administration proposal would have lowered such \"petroleum-equivalent fuel economy\" ratings for EVs by 72% in 2027. The final rule will instead gradually reduce the equivalency ratings through 2030 by a total of 65%, giving automakers more time to adjust.\n",
      "\n",
      "The industry cheered the Energy Department announcement. John Bozella, chief executive of the auto trade group Alliance for Automotive innovation, said the earlier proposal would \"perversely disincentivize the production of battery electric vehicles\" by scaling back EV fuel-economy credits that helped automakers meet federal regulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new federal rules will govern all automakers selling U.S. vehicles but the biggest impact will be on the Detroit Three because of their heavy reliance on sales of large trucks and SUVs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Automakers and the United Auto Workers union have also raised alarms that the administration's prior proposal could have resulted in U.S. automakers facing $10.5 billion in CAFE fines through 2032 for not meeting fuel-economy requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "General Motors would have faced $6.5 billion in fines, followed by Chrysler parent Stellantis with $3 billion, and Ford $1 billion through 2032. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is set to propose final revised CAFE rules this spring.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Biden administration's final auto tailpipe emissions standards and related rules, including the Energy Department regulation announced on Tuesday, will give automakers more leeway to continue selling combustion vehicles, including gas-electric hybrids, through 2030.\n",
      "\n",
      "Separately, the Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday will unveil revised 2027-2032 vehicle emissions requirements that will also soften the blow to automakers by easing proposed rules through 2030 and then ramping up requirements through 2032.\n",
      "\n",
      "EPA forecast last year the rules would result in automakers building 60% EVs by 2030; the final rules may allow automakers to build 50% EVs or less in 2030.\n",

      "Approximately 95% of nonorganic strawberries, leafy greens such as spinach and kale, collard and mustard greens, grapes, peaches and pears tested by the United States government contained detectable levels of pesticides, according to the 2024 Shopper’s Guide to Pesticides in Produce.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nectarines, apples, bell and hot peppers, cherries, blueberries and green beans rounded out the list of the 12 most contaminated samples of produce. It’s dubbed the “Dirty Dozen” by the Environmental Working Group, or EWG, an environmental and health advocacy organization that has produced the annual report since 2004.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pesticides have been linked in studies to preterm births, congenital malformations such as neural tube defects, spontaneous abortions and an increase in genetic damage in humans. Exposure to pesticides has also been associated with lower sperm concentrations, heart disease, cancer and other disorders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Farmworkers who use or are exposed to pesticides are at highest risk, according to studies.

Avocados, sweet corn, pineapples, onions and papayas led the “Clean Fifteen” list of conventionally grown produce with the least amount of trace pesticides — nearly 65% of the fruits and veggies in that grouping had no detectable pesticide residues, according to the report released Wednesday.\n",

      "Washed, peeled and scrubbed\n",
      "\n",
      "Each year, a rotating list of domestic and imported produce is tested by US Department of Agriculture and US Food and Drug Administration. Staffers at the USDA Pesticide Data Program wash, peel and scrub fruits and vegetables as consumers would, while workers at the FDA only brush dirt off the produce. Then the fruits and vegetables are tested for more than 250 different pesticides and the results are posted online.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 2024, EWG researchers examined testing data on 47,510 samples of 46 nonorganic fruits and vegetables, with the majority of testing from the USDA. An analysis of that data found traces of 254 pesticides in all fruits and vegetables analyzed, with 209 of those chemicals on produce in the “Dirty Dozen” list.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We find that what ends up on one list versus the other reflects how those fruits and vegetables are grown,” said Alexis Temkin, EWG’s senior toxicologist. “Avocados, for example, aren’t pesticide intensive, while strawberries grow very close to the ground and have a lot of pests.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Report is unfair to farmers, critics say\n",
      "\n",
      "About 70% of nonorganic produce tested by the USDA and FDA have pesticide levels within the legal limits allowed by the US Environmental Protection Agency, according to the EWG report. That fact makes the report misleading, said Carl Winter, emeritus professor of cooperative extension at the University of California, Davis.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The dose makes the poison, not its presence or its absence, and that dose determines the potential for harm. In many cases you’d have to be exposed to a million times more than what we’re exposed to before you’d even see any effects,” said Winter, speaking on behalf of the Alliance on Food and Farming, which represents organic and conventional farmers.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, “legal levels do not mean safe levels,” Temkin said in response. She pointed to times when regulators allowed potentially dangerous chemicals, such as the pesticide DCPA, to remain on the market long after scientific research had raised concerns. The herbicide was linked to thyroid concerns for years before the EPA told the public the chemical posed “significant risks to human health” in 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another example: chlorpyrifos, a pesticide linked to brain damage in children and fetuses. The American Academy of Pediatrics joined EWG in 2017 protesting the EPA’s continued approval of the chemical.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, pesticides banned by the government continue to show up on crops sold in the US, according to the EWG report.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Green beans for example, continue to show traces of acephate, a toxic pesticide the EPA banned for use on green beans more than 10 years ago,” Temkin said. “A lot of pesticides found on the ‘Dirty Dozen’ have also been banned in the European Union because of their harmful effects on human health.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Another concern from critics is that the “Dirty Dozen” list is insulting to multigenerational farmers who struggle to grow food for the nation and feed those same products to their own children, said Steve Clement, CEO of Pacific Northwest Tree Fruit\n",
      "\n",
      "“When this report comes out it’s like getting stabbed a little bit because we’re working so hard to put out a nice healthy product, and the implication of the ‘Dirty Dozen’ list is that it is unhealthy,” Clement said. “It’s like doing something kind for somebody and then having them turn around and call you some sort of monster.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The report may scare people away from eating the fruits and vegetables they need, said Neil Nagata, whose family has grown organic and conventional strawberries in Oceanside, California, for decades.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Every time the report comes out, or there’s a scare on imported strawberries, we see our sales drop off,” Nagata said. “It’s not as if we’re doing something that is wrong or incorrect, we’re actually producing very healthy, safe food. In fact, we actually live in the strawberry field and my father is 100 and my mom is 97, and they still eat strawberries.”\n",

      "It is important that people eat lots of fruits and vegetables, even conventionally grown, said EWG’s Temkin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We always emphasize that,” she said. “We want to enable consumers who wish to avoid as many pesticides as possible by opting for organic versions of the ‘Dirty Dozen,’ where pesticide levels will be lower, and then, if they wish, choose less expensive conventionally grown produce from the ‘Clean Fifteen.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "Organic produce is not more nutritious, but studies have found that levels of pesticides in the urine of adults and children can drop up to 95% after a switch to an organic diet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fungicide levels were high\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first time, EWG analysts looked at reported levels of fungicides, one form of pesticide used to kill fungal diseases such as powdery mildew.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Four out of five of the most frequently found pesticides on the ‘Dirty Dozen’ list were fungicides, and they were also found in particularly high concentrations,” Temkin said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two fungicides — fludioxonil and pyrimethanil — had the highest concentration on the “Dirty Dozen” list of any other pesticide, according to the report. Fludioxonil was found on 90% of peaches and nearly 30% of all “Dirty Dozen” samples, according to the report. Pyrimethanil was found on 65% of pear, 30% of apple, 27% of grape, 26% of strawberry and 24% of nectarine samples.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fungicides are often applied after harvest to keep produce mold-free on its way to market. That’s likely why the concentrations were so high on some samples – higher than other pesticides applied earlier in the growing season,” Temkin said. “The application of the fungicide is also closer to the time the produce is put on store shelves and consumers are eating them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Fludioxonil creates a waxy coating on the fruit or vegetable that studies find is difficult to wash away. While the EPA finds fludioxonil safe at regulated levels, some studies have raised concerns that it might disrupt hormone and neurological systems. Exposing breast cancer cells to fludioxonil in a petri dish found the fungicide increased cell production by 1.5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pyrimethanil was classified as a “possible human carcinogen” by the EPA in 2004, but the agency determined in 2015 the chemical was “not likely to be carcinogenic to humans” at low doses. Studies have shown it to be toxic to tree frogs and aquatic life, and it may disrupt thyroid levels in pregnant women living in agricultural areas. In lab tests, pyrimethanil and fludioxonil were show to impact androgen activity — hormones that contribute to growth and reproduction in both men and women.\n",

      "Ways to reduce pesticides in your food\n",

      "Fiordaliso feels that those who changed their minds may have done so because of issues with other relatives who owned shares of the same property.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abandoned buildings in old Italian towns are sometimes split between multiple heirs who own just a section – like a bathroom, balcony, kitchen - and nothing can be sold without written consent from all heirs, as per Italian law.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past, it was customary for children to inherit parts of their family home, including patches of land, wells and orchards.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it’s not always a guarantee that relatives will still be on good terms and/or in contact years down the line.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The disposal of potential one euro homes faced a deadlock as most relatives sharing the same property were at odds with one another for personal reasons or couldn’t agree on the sale, some hardly spoke or knew each other, others lived in distant cities and even abroad,” says the mayor.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some instances, homes were never officially split between heirs in the past, so the ownership line had broken along the way without a clear indication as to who should be the current owner.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Fiordaliso, tracking down the descendants of owners who’d long migrated overseas, mainly to the US, Canada and Argentina and perhaps had different last names, or may have passed on their Italian property to foreigners without notifying Patrica’s town hall, has been a very hard task.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s like looking for a needle in a haystack,” he adds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only two abandoned homes that Patrica managed to sell as part of its one-euro scheme were fully owned by two locals, so no liaising with fourth-degree cousins or great-great-grandsons was required, and they could sell the properties without any complications.\n",

      "And original owners who’ve been living elsewhere for many years may be wary of making themselves known to local authorities and potentially being hit with back taxes for their property and waste disposal charges of up to 2,500 euros (around $2,730 per year, plus unpaid utility bills\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reason that the one euro scheme never really kicked off in Patrica could be due to the condition of its forsaken homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the houses are simply too neglected to sell, even if the owners were willing to agree to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Patrica local Gianni Valleco and his two brothers decided to place their parents’ abandoned home on the market to see what would happen, but soon found that the house was far from desirable.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We thought, ‘Why not give it a go’? Even if it’s just for one euro, we’d be rid of a heap of useless stones. We were curious to see if someone might be interested anyway in buying it,” says Valleco.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We were aware that after half a century our parents’ home had turned into rubble, it was totally destroyed, like razed to the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The roof and most walls had collapsed, leaving an open-air room covered in grass and bushes. All there remained was a patch of land, an ugly garden right in the heart of the historical center.”\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Valleco, a neighbor had been using what remained of the home to dump their old stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We then realized nobody would ever buy it,” he says. “It’s a bad investment requiring lots of money to rebuild the house. It’s more worth buying a tiny rural cottage in the surroundings.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thankfully, not all of the deserted homes in Patrica that could be potentially sold for one euro are in quite such a terrible state, and some have garnered interest from potential buyers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A few foreigners came to see the abandoned one-euro dwellings. There was lots of interest but unfortunately we had nothing to offer them,” says the mayor, adding that those interested were from the US and Europe.\n",

      "\n",
      "The town hall recently funded the makeover of the external façades of some ancient palazzos, prompting several locals to entirely restyle their old family homes and put them to use after decades of neglect.\n",

      "Local resident Alessandra Pagliarosi took things a step further by turning the 1950s mansion inherited by her husband into an elegant B&B called Patricia.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We redid the roof, which was practically no longer there, and the interior. The mayor’s move finally gave us a good excuse to fully renovate the property which had been sitting there uselessly,” says Pagliarosi, who benefited from the new tax breaks introduced by the town hall to revive the local economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those who decide to kickstart a commercial activity like an B&B or artisan boutique in the ancient district are exempt from paying taxes on waste disposal, advertisement and public space use for 10 years and granted tax credits for restructuring costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For a small B&B, that would amount to a total of roughly 1,200 euros (around $1,310) per year in tax savings, which is a significant amount of money,” says Pagliarosi.\n",
      "\n",
      "Foreigners planning to relocate to Patrica and launch a small business are also entitled to the tax benefits.\n",

      "\n",
      "“There is interest, but then when many (foreigners) actually see the bad shape of the old homes they’d prefer to opt for turn-key apartments that are already restyled or in need of just minor fixes,” says Grossi.\n",

Was he serious?\n",

      "On the morning of January 6, 2021, in a last-ditch bid to overturn his election loss, then-President Donald Trump told then-Vice President Mike Pence that his decision to uphold his constitutional duty and certify the results later that day would be “a political career killer,” according to a witness who overheard part of the call.\n",
      "\n",
      "The witness, a White House valet who was with Trump during most of that fateful day, described the phone call to the now-defunct House committee that investigated the January 6 insurrection. He could only recall Trump’s side of the conversation, but he recounted a direct threat delivered by the outgoing president to his own vice president.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mike, this is a political career killer if you do this,” Trump said. “Do what’s right.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The transcript of the valet’s testimony, first obtained by the New York Times, wasn’t made public by the January 6 committee before they dissolved in early 2023, but House Republicans released it Friday. The valet was not identified by name.\n",
      "\n",
      "The call between Trump and Pence was their last contact before Trump delivered his incendiary speech at the Ellipse, where he told thousands of his most ardent supporters to march to the US Capitol and “fight like hell” to stop Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 election, during a joint session that Pence would be presiding over.\n",
      "\n",
      "The valet told lawmakers he didn’t hear what Trump was referring to when he told Pence that he shouldn’t “do this.” But the context makes clear that Trump was trying one last time to convince Pence to overturn the results by throwing out Democratic electors and seating Republican electors instead while presiding over the joint session.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before that call, Pence and his top advisers had repeatedly told Trump there was no legal basis to meddle in the electoral vote tally and that it would violate the Constitution. In a letter to lawmakers on January 6, Pence said what Trump wanted him to do would be “entirely antithetical” to “our Constitution, our laws, and our history.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not believe that the Founders of our country intended to invest the Vice President with unilateral authority to decide which electoral votes should be counted during the Joint Session of Congress, and no Vice President in American history has ever asserted such authority,” Pence wrote to lawmakers in his letter disavowing Trump’s theories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump’s threat to Pence proved true. Pence declared his candidacy for the 2024 GOP nomination in June but never gained traction with the Trump-loving Republican base. He dropped out in October and announced last week that he would not endorse Trump.\n",

      "A glowing worm moon will light up the sky on Monday with a celestial performance in store for people venturing out in the early morning hours — a penumbral lunar eclipse.\n",
      "\n",
      "March’s full moon, referred to as the worm moon by the Farmers’ Almanac due to its proximity to the spring equinox, will be at its fullest at 3 a.m. ET.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few hours earlier, starting at 12:53 a.m. ET, according to EarthSky, the moon will be almost perfectly aligned with the sun and Earth, causing the outer edge of Earth’s shadow, known as the penumbra, to be cast onto the glowing orb.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moon looks slightly darker during a 2023 penumbral lunar eclipse in Banda Aceh, Indonesia. On Monday, the lunar event will begin at 12:53 a.m. ET. Chaideer Mahyuddin/AFP/Getty Images\n",
      "\n",
      "The greatest eclipse will be at 3:12 a.m. ET, when the moon will appear to be slightly darker than usual, said Dr. Shannon Schmoll, director of the Abrams Planetarium at Michigan State University.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’ll be almost a gradient of darkening happening from one side of the moon to the other. It’s not going to be a super dramatic change in what we see in the moon,” Schmoll said. “But if you’re sitting there watching it, you might notice some slight variations in brightness.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The worm moon — named by Native American tribes in reference to the beetle larvae and other creatures that emerge from hibernation in the spring — will be visible to everyone across the world, since the moon will appear to be full for a couple of days.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the penumbral eclipse will only be visible to those who are on the night side of Earth when the event occurs, including Europe, North and East Asia, Australia, Africa, North America and South America. The lunar eclipse will finish at 5:33 a.m. ET, according to EarthSky.\n",
      "\n",
      "The penumbral eclipse comes about two weeks before a total solar eclipse that will cross Mexico, the United States and Canada on April 8. Lunar and solar eclipses always come in pairs due to the period when the sun, Earth and moon stay aligned, Schmoll said. While the full moon will be caught in Earth’s shadow during this penumbral eclipse, the moon’s next new moon phase will allow for the conditions needed for a solar eclipse, when the moon will be in between the sun and Earth and thus block the face of the sun from view.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eclipse season\n",
      "\n",
      "An “eclipse season” is the approximate 35-day period that occurs every six months, near the equinoxes, when the near-perfect alignment of the three celestial bodies needed for eclipses occurs, according to NASA.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lunar eclipse does not happen monthly during each full moon because the moon’s orbital plane is tilted by about 5 degrees, so for most full moons, the shadow of the Earth will be just below or above the moon, Schmoll said.\n",
      "\n",
      "While a penumbral eclipse is not as dramatic as a total lunar eclipse with the moon appearing an eerie red, there is no special equipment required to view a lunar eclipse such as the viewing glasses needed for a solar eclipse, Schmoll said, allowing for lunar eclipses to be viewed with the naked eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You pretty much just need to be outside with a clear view of the moon when it’s happening,” Schmoll added. “(Eclipses are) always a good excuse to go outside and try to look at the sky and appreciate where we are in the universe, and what we are able to observe from our planet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Solar and lunar eclipses\n",
      "\n",
      "While the most highly anticipated of the four eclipse events occurring in 2024 is the total solar eclipse on April 8, an annular solar eclipse will occur on October 2 over parts of South America. This type of eclipse is similar to a total solar eclipse, except the moon is at the farthest point in its orbit from Earth, so it can’t completely block the sun. Instead, annular solar eclipses create a “ring of fire” in the sky as the sun’s fiery light surrounds the moon’s shadow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, a partial lunar eclipse, in which Earth moves between the sun and the full moon without being perfectly aligned, will appear over Europe and much of Asia, Africa, North America and South America between September 17 and 18.\n",
      "\n",
      "Check Time and Date’s website to see when each of these eclipses will appear.\n",

      "More full moons this year\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the 12 full moons in 2024, the September and October lunar events will be considered supermoons, according to EarthSky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Definitions of a supermoon can vary, but the term generally denotes a full moon that is closer to Earth than normal and thus appears larger and brighter in the night sky. Some astronomers say the phenomenon occurs when the moon is within 90% of perigee — its closest approach to Earth in orbit.\n",

      "Join us as we discuss the crucial role of investment in women's healthcare and the innovative strides Hologic is making toward inclusive and progressive healthcare solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, please introduce yourself and Hologic. More specifically, how does Hologic's mission align with the 2024 International Women's Day theme of \"Invest in Women: Accelerate Progress\" and ''#Inspireinclusion''?\n",
      "\n",
      "Tim: I’m Tim Simpson, General Manager UK & Ireland at Hologic. Hologic is a global champion of women’s health, providing innovations designed to detect, diagnose, and treat women’s health conditions. We see it as our mission to advance women’s health, and for this to happen in the UK, targeted investments in research and technology are crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sarah: I’m Sarah Smith, Senior Marketing Manager, Surgical Gynaecology, EMEA. Improvement in women’s healthcare only begins when there is investment in empowering women to feel confident to know when to talk to a healthcare professional (HCP) about their health concerns. By the same token, we also need to invest in educating HCPs so that when a woman speaks to their GP, they leave feeling heard and understood.\n",

      "Learn more about Hologic\n",
      "\n",
      "From your perspective, why is putting women at the heart of decision-making critical in advancing women's healthcare?\n",
      "\n",
      "Sarah: Putting women at the heart of all decisions is the cornerstone of patient-centered care. Shared decision-making is needed to ensure that the patient and clinician work together to make the best healthcare decision for the individual.\n",
      "\n",
      "In women’s health, it is particularly important to champion shared decision-making. High rates of misdiagnosis, myths, and misperceptions about conditions1,2, as well as barriers to dialogue due to the sensitive nature of some conditions, can often leave women in the dark when it comes to decisions about their health and treatment.2\n",
      "\n",
      "Providing women with better education via initiatives, such as our Wear White Again awareness campaign for women suffering from Heavy Menstrual Bleeding, is vital in empowering them to seek help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Improved education and knowledge can make a considerable difference, especially in situations where dialogue barriers may prevent women from clearly communicating their condition's impact on their lives. Equally, providing clinicians with relevant and up-to-date information is crucial so that when women present symptoms, the conversations between them and their clinicians are productive and satisfactory for both parties.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of reducing health inequalities, what are some of the barriers to accessing quality healthcare for women, and how is Hologic working to overcome these challenges?\n",
      "\n",
      "Tim: We know from our annual Hologic Global Women’s Health Index that cancer testing amongst women has improved. However, our supplementary research found that women from ethnic minorities (non-white women) reported lower attendance for breast cancer screening (11% vs. 25%), compared with white women.”3,4 It is concerning to see these discrepancies, as we know cancer can affect anyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the main barriers to attending screenings is being time-poor, with another being not having access to the correct health information. We know it’s vital that health information is accessible for all and translated into multiple languages.\n",
      "\n",
      "To tackle these inequalities, we must work in partnership with different organizations, for example, charities that hold vital insights into women’s experiences, to better understand how we make breast cancer screening accessible for all.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2021, we partnered with Manchester-based charity, Prevent Breast Cancer for our global Project Health Equality Campaign, which engaged with hundreds of women to raise awareness of breast cancer and the importance of attending their screening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both breast and cervical cancer remain a significant concern worldwide. Could you discuss the efficiencies Hologic is implementing to help reduce the incidence of these common cancers?\n",
      "\n",
      "Tim: We believe diagnostic innovation is key to helping detect cancers early, therefore improving the chances of a better outcome. Both cervical and breast cancer screening are well suited for digital technologies and the application of artificial intelligence (AI), given both require highly trained medical professionals to identify rare, subtle changes visually. This process can be labor-intensive and time-consuming. AI and computer vision are technologies that could help to improve this significantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "AI and increased screening units and mammographers can potentially increase breast cancer screening capacity by removing the need for review by two radiologists5.\n",
      "\n",
      "When AI-guided imaging is used as part of a screening program, it could effectively and efficiently highlight the areas that are of particular interest to the reader, in the case of breast screening or cytotechnologists, when considering cervical screening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, AI can be used for risk stratification, meaning it could help identify women who are particularly at risk and push them further up the queue for regular screening.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, women with dense breast tissue have a greater risk factor than having two immediate family members who have suffered from breast cancer. What is more, dense breasts make it more difficult to identify cancerous cells in standard mammograms6. This means that in some cases, cancers may be missed, and in others, women will be unnecessarily recalled for further investigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Could you discuss the advancements in diagnosing and treating heavy menstrual bleeding and how these impact women's lives?\n",
      "\n",
      "Sarah: Our research conducted in 2022 found that only a quarter of those who reported symptoms of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) (24%) have received a formal diagnosis. Perhaps even more concerning is that nearly half of the women who experience symptoms of the condition (42%) have not spoken to their GP about them, demonstrating a potential belief that it is something to be endured rather than managed7.\n",
      "\n",
      "GPs cannot be experts in every area, and as they continue to do more with limited resources, it is vital to ensure that primary care is supported to understand HMB better. This is a point echoed by the Women’s Health Strategy, which has the ambition of healthcare professionals in primary care to be well-informed and trained in menstrual and gynecological health8.\n",

      "Alongside this research, Hologic has launched a report entitled, ‘The right patients, the right setting, the right clinicians’ to set out its vision on tackling HMB. The report recommends launching Women’s Health Hubs and the development of a specific Office for Health Improvement and Disparities communication campaign to support clinicians with building a greater knowledge of menstrual conditions, so GPs can effectively recognise and diagnose HMB.\n",
      "\n",
      "How does Hologic's approach to women's health care exemplify innovation in addressing long-standing health issues like endometriosis and menstrual health?\n",
      "\n",
      "Sarah: Part of our approach at Hologic when championing women’s healthcare is to make sure we connect with key stakeholders along the patient pathway, as we know we need to work collaboratively to change the status quo. This attitude is reflected in our everyday lives - I spend much of my time speaking to clinicians and patients to understand better the challenges they face and the solutions we can collectively create.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the approach we took when conducting the heavy menstrual bleeding roundtable. We made sure we had a diverse set of menstrual health experts who could speak to different parts of the patient pathway. We were also honored to be joined by Dame Lesley Regan, the first Women’s Health Ambassador for England.\n",

      "How does Hologic UK & Ireland measure the impact of its initiatives on women's health, and what benchmarks do you use to evaluate success in contributing to the broader goals of healthcare equity and access?\n",
      "\n",
      "Tim: At Hologic, we believe you cannot improve what you don’t measure, so we must continue to collect vital data to help us pinpoint how we best support women across the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2021, we launched the Hologic Global Women’s Health Index (HGWHI)*, a globally comparative study in partnership with Gallup, to measure and monitor the behaviors and attitudes influencing women’s access to quality healthcare. It provides us with a unique insight into the experiences of women across the globe, including the UK. HGWHI runs annually; we’re launching the UK data in May.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our ambition is that the HGWHI results, in partnership with research from key organizations, will help to form a quality data set that can be used as a benchmark for how UK women perceive their health in the years to come.\n",

      "​As leaders in the healthcare industry, how do you foresee the role of technology evolving to further support women's health initiatives in the next decade?\n",
      "\n",
      "Tim: We know that preventing disease saves lives9. Therefore, as a business leader, I believe technology should lie at the heart of prevention, detection, and diagnosis. Technology for breast cancer screening is an area where investment is crucial to meet women’s health needs in preventative health.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, many screening programs use traditional 2D mammography technology, which makes identifying cancer lesions more difficult in dense breasts. Therefore, investing in technology such as tomosynthesis (3D Mammography) for breast cancer screening would help provide the reassurance that women deserve. Tomosynthesis detects up to 65% more invasive breast cancers when compared to traditional 2D Mammography alone10.**\n",
      "\n",
      "The second method of improving breast and cervical cancer screening programs is using artificial intelligence (AI) to support reading images. Therefore, investing in digital infrastructure is crucial to improving the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis, as it will ultimately lead to earlier treatment and, thus, better patient outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Endometriosis Month coincides with International Women's Day. How is Hologic raising awareness and advancing treatment options for this often-overlooked condition?\n",
      "\n",
      "Sarah: This year’s Endometriosis Month theme is, ‘Could it be endometriosis?’ which makes me think about all the undiagnosed women and girls living in pain. At Hologic, we prioritize fostering relationships with stakeholders and policymakers to raise awareness of what is needed to improve women’s health and the importance of treating gynecological health.\n",
      "\n",
      "As previously mentioned, the HMB roundtable with Dame Lesley Regan, the first Women’s Health Ambassador for England, and other influential leaders from across the continuum of menstrual health care to discuss how we can improve patient pathways for heavy menstrual bleeding was a recent example.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, we recognize the importance of data to understand women’s conditions and care and, therefore, conducted research in 2022. This data collected provided the below insights on pain 4:\n",
      "\n",
      "Nearly a quarter of women in the UK experience pain daily, and a fifth of those have had to stop working because of their pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among these respondents, the top causes were joint pain, backache, and headache. Women also reported pain due to periods, menopause, heavy menstrual bleeding, and endometriosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "It takes women, on average, 4.29 visits with a healthcare professional before being diagnosed with the cause of their pain, with just more than a quarter of women still not having a diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Hologic, we believe that to achieve improvement in the treatment of women’s pain is two-fold. We need to continue to educate healthcare professionals (HCPs), so they are provided with the most up-to-date information to diagnose menstrual conditions effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also need to ensure that HCPs know that diagnosis and treatment can be overwhelming for the patient and allow time to support patients through the process, setting clear expectations to avoid disappointment post-treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can you share a success story or case study where Hologic's initiatives directly impact women's healthcare outcomes?\n",
      "\n",
      "Tim: We’ve seen first-hand the positive impact AI-guided imaging can directly have on women’s healthcare outcomes. An example of this would be the UK’s first pilot of digital cytology in cervical cancer screening at University Hospital Monklands.\n",
      "\n",
      "The technology rapidly reviews test slides, providing the screener with the most diagnostically relevant cells. The initial results are promising, with the hospital reporting increased capacity in slide assessment and improved analysis turnaround times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Allan Wilson, Consultant Biomedical Scientist at NHS Lanarkshire, who led the pilot project, commented on the possibilities of the technology in allowing screeners to dedicate more time to training on the latest technologies and dealing with difficult-to-diagnose cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also noted that with advanced technology, giving women their results quicker increases their confidence in cervical cancer screening while reducing the likelihood of a false negative so any pre-cancerous changes can be picked up and treated earlier before they become cancerous.​​​​​​\n",
      "\n",
      "How does Hologic ensure that women's voices and experiences are incorporated into the development and improvement of gynaecological surgical solutions?\n",
      "\n",
      "Sarah: At Hologic, we work extremely closely with patient groups and women's charities to better understand the patient's voice. They hold key knowledge and insights about the patient’s experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the Heavy Menstrual Bleeding Roundtable that I referenced earlier, we brought together experts from different parts of the patient pathway to ensure that women’s experiences were an integral part of the discussion. This meant that their views shaped the resulting report. helped ensure that we were able to understand a woman’s experience. This, in turn, helps us to improve our services and solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking towards the future, what are the main areas of women's health that Hologic is focusing on for research and development?\n",
      "\n",
      "Tim: Hologic is passionate about delivering solutions that are based on data-driven insights that improve women’s well-being. As we look ahead to the future, we will continue to invest in developing our solutions and services that enable healthcare professionals to provide better healthcare to women.\n",
      "\n",

      "About 74,000 years ago, Sumatra’s Mount Toba experienced a super-eruption, one of the largest in Earth’s history, potentially kicking off a massive disruption in the world’s climate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some scientists have suspected a volcanic winter resulting from the eruption was a big enough shift to wipe out most early humans due to genetic evidence suggesting a steep drop in the human population. But now a cutting-edge study on an archaeological site in northwest Ethiopia once occupied by early modern humans has added to a growing body of evidence that suggests the event might not have been so apocalyptic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, the new research found humans in that location, known as Shinfa-Metema 1, adapted to the arid conditions brought on by the volcanic eruption in a way that may have facilitated humanity’s pivotal migration out of Africa to the rest of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Microscopic fragments of volcanic glass found alongside stone tools and animal remains in the same layer of sediment at the Shinfa-Metema 1 site, near Ethiopia’s Shinfa River, show humans were occupying the site before and after the volcano erupted more than 4,000 miles away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“These fragments are less than the diameter of a human hair. Even as tiny as (that) they are still big enough to analyze the chemistry and the trace elements,” said John Kappelman, a professor of anthropology and geological science at the University of Texas at Austin and lead author of the study, which published Wednesday in the journal Nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "By piecing together clues from the fossils and artifacts found at the site, along with geological and molecular analysis, the team began to understand how the humans living there forged ahead despite the likely climate shift that the volcanic cataclysm triggered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Excavations at the Shinfa-Metema 1 site have revealed that a population of humans survived the eruption of the Mount Toba supervolcano 74,000 years ago. John Kappelman and Marsha Miller\n",
      "\n",
      "Catching fish\n",
      "\n",
      "To understand the climate around the time of the eruption, Kappelman and his colleagues analyzed oxygen and carbon isotopes, variations of the same element, from ostrich eggshells and fossilized mammal teeth. That work shed light on water intake and revealed the animals ate plants that were more likely to grow in drier conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The isotopes are incorporated in the hard tissues. So for the mammals, we look at their teeth, the enamel of their teeth, but we also find it in the eggshell of the ostrich,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "An analysis of the site’s flora and fauna also found an abundance of fish remains in the aftermath of the eruption. The finding is perhaps not surprising given how near the site was to the river, but fish are rare in other Stone Age sites from the same period, the study noted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“People start to increase the percentage of fish in the diet when Toba comes in. They’re capturing and processing almost four times as much fish (as before the eruption),” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We think the reason for that is because if Toba is in fact, creating more aridity, that means it’s going to be a shorter wet season, which means longer dry season.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The team theorized that the drier climate, counterintuitively, explains the increased reliance on fish: As the river shrank, fish were trapped in water holes or shallower streams that hunters could more easily target.\n",
      "\n",
      "Blue vs. green corridor\n",
      "\n",
      "The fish-rich water holes may have potentially created what the team described as a “blue corridor,” along which early humans moved north out of Africa once they were depleted of fish. This theory contradicts most other models that suggest that humanity’s main migration out of Africa took place along “green corridors” during humid periods.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This study … demonstrates the great plasticity of Homo sapiens populations and their ability to adapt easily to any type of environment, whether hyper-humid or hyper-arid, including during catastrophic events such as the hyper-explosion of the Toba volcano,” said Ludovic Slimak, a researcher at the French National Centre for Scientific Research and the University of Toulouse, in an email. Slimak was not involved in the research.\n",
      "\n",
      "The study authors were also able to explore the geology of the ancient riverbed, which suggested that it flowed slower and lower at that point than in the present.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We can do that by just looking at the cobbles,” Kappelman said. “A very energetic river can move bigger boulders and cobbles than a river that isn’t that (energetic.) What (cobbles) we find for the ancestor river are smaller than the river today.”\n",

      "\n",
      "The researchers also uncovered the remains of several small triangular points, which tantalizingly rank among the earliest examples of the use of archery and provide clues that the site’s inhabitants might have used bows and arrows to hunt fish and other larger prey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slimak, who has studied similar points discovered in France that date back 50,000 years, agreed with the new study’s assessment of the artifacts.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The authors also highlight very clear indicators suggesting the existence of archery here 74,000 years ago,” Slimak said. “There is therefore every reason to … consider these ancient Homo sapiens as bearers of already highly advanced technologies, largely emancipated from natural and climatic constraints, crucial factors for understanding their migrations later on, across all continents and under all latitudes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Ancient species of humans likely left Africa multiple times, but archaeologists and geneticists largely agree that the most significant dispersal of Homo sapiens, our own species — which ultimately led to modern humans living in every corner of the globe — took place around 70,000 to 50,000 years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new research offers another potential scenario for how this dispersal happened while not ruling out previous theories, said Chris Stringer, a professor and research leader in human evolution at the Natural History Museum in London, who called it an “intriguing paper.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m sure each of these propositions will fuel debate amongst the relevant specialists but I think the authors have made a plausible (though not definitive) case for each scenario they propose,” Stringer said via email.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course this new work doesn’t mean that humid corridors were not still important conduits for dispersals out of Africa, but this work adds credible additional possibilities during more arid phases.”\n",

      "With its striking coloration, the giant panda is an instantly recognizable species.\n",
      "\n",
      "A handful of giant pandas that aren’t black-and-white, however, do exist. These majestic creatures with brown-and-white fur inhabit a single mountain range in China. And now, scientists may have unraveled the mystery of the extremely rare pandas’ unusual coats, according to new research.\n",
      "\n",
      "The work, which involved studying the genetics of multiple pandas in the wild and in captivity, has suggested that pandas with brown-and-white coats are the result of natural variation, rather than a sign of inbreeding in a dwindling population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first brown panda known to science was a female named Dandan. A local ranger found the ailing bear in Foping County in Shaanxi province’s Qinling Mountains in March 1985. The panda was held in captivity until her death in 2000.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Dandan’s discovery decades ago, there have been 11 reported sightings documented through official news sources or personal accounts shared with the authors of this latest study that appeared in the journal PNAS on March 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The recurring instances of brown pandas imply that this trait may be inheritable. However, to date, the genetic basis underlying the brown-and-white coat color remains unclear,” the authors wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gaining a better understanding of the distinctive coloration could help inform efforts to breed brown-and-white pandas in captivity, said senior author Dr. Fuwen Wei, a professor of wildlife ecology and conservation biology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Zoology in Beijing. The status of the giant panda as a species is vulnerable, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species.\n",

      "A panda family tree\n",
      "\n",
      "To understand what lies behind the trait, the researchers studied Qizai, a male brown panda rescued as a cub in 2009 from Foping National Nature Reserve in Hanzhong. He is currently the only brown panda in captivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "When compared under a microscope with hair samples from three black-and-white pandas, Qizai’s brownish fur had fewer and smaller melanosomes, tiny structures found in cells that are responsible for skin and hair pigment in mammals. What’s more, the melanosomes were more likely to be irregularly shaped, the study team found.\n",
      "\n",
      "The researchers then gathered genetic information about Qizai and pieced together his family tree. Fresh scat, or bear poop, gathered at the nature reserve revealed the identity of his wild mother, a black-and-white female panda that wears a tracking collar and is known as Niuniu.\n",
      "\n",
      "The researchers also identified Qizai’s son, a black-and-white panda born in captivity in 2020. (The study team later identified Qizai’s father, Xiyue, a wild but tracked black-and-white panda, by studying the genetics of a wider population of pandas.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The scientists studied the genetic information from Qizai’s family members and compared it with the genetic information from 12 black-and-white pandas from the Qinling Mountains and 17 black-and-white pandas from other regions in China using information taken from scat and blood samples.\n",
      "\n",
      "While none of Qizai’s immediate family members had brown fur, the researchers were able to show that his parents and son all had one copy of the recessive trait on a gene known as Bace2, while Qizai had two copies.\n",
      "\n",
      "An individual’s genes can carry recessive traits, such as blue eyes or red hair in humans, without appearing as a physical characteristic. Each parent must possess a copy of the genetic variant and pass it on in order for the trait to appear in the offspring, as is the case with Qizai.\n",
      "\n",
      "Genetic analysis solves an enigma\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to an analysis of a tissue sample stored for more than two decades in ethanol, the scientists also were able to sequence the genome of Dandan, the first known brown panda. Dandan had the same recessive trait, the researchers found.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scientists then conducted a wider analysis of 192 black-and-white giant pandas to verify the responsible gene as Bace2. The mutation causing the brown coats was only present in two pandas hailing from the Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi, not Sichuan province, where the majority of China’s giant pandas live.\n",
      "\n",
      "To confirm the findings, the scientists used the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing tool to delete the genetic sequence they had identified as causing the mutation in the Bace2 gene in 78 lab mice. The change reduced the number and size of melanosomes in the mice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The coat color of knockout mice is light brown,” said Wei, who is also president at Jiangxi Agricultural University in Nanchang in China’s Jiangxi province.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It proves that this deletion has the potential to alter the coat color of a mouse, as the pigmentation pathway is relatively conserved (shared) among mammals. Therefore, it is very likely that this mutation influences the coat color of a brown panda.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Natural variation vs. inbreeding\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s not clear what caused the genetic mutation. Wei said it must be linked to the specific environment of the Qinling Mountains, which has a different climate than Sichuan. The genetic mutation did not appear to be a result of inbreeding, as once suspected, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is more likely to be a result of natural variation rather than inbreeding. Our kinship analysis indicates that Qizai’s parents are not closely related,” Wei added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tiejun Wang, an associate professor in the department of natural resources at the University of Twente in the Netherlands, said it was good news that the unique coloration did not appear to be the result of inbreeding. Wang, who has studied brown pandas, was not involved in the study.\n",

      "As news that Catherine, Princess of Wales had announced her cancer diagnosis dominated headlines Friday, I felt a deep and traumatic solidarity. Recovering from major abdominal surgery — as Kate has been since January — is ghastly, and having to do it so you can be healthy enough for chemotherapy is a humbling one-two punch from the universe. For Kate, that’s topped off by having to endure it all while the entire world chases you down like a fox on one of those hunts the royals are always throwing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sara Stewart Todd Thompson\n",
      "\n",
      "Kate has not yet disclosed specifically what kind of cancer she has. An oncologist told Today.com that it could be colon, stomach, genital or urinary cancer. We know that rates of colon cancer diagnoses in particular are going up alarmingly in younger populations. I was 45 when I received my diagnosis of stage 3 colon cancer, and, like Kate, underwent major abdominal surgery followed by chemo. I was told by countless doctors and nurses that they were seeing an upsetting uptick in younger patients like me.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the first things health care providers recommend to aid your recovery from surgery is reducing your stress. I truly cannot imagine trying to deal with the indignities of post-surgical recovery — such as, in my case not being able to walk even a single block unassisted for weeks, or being incontinent when you used to be a normal healthy person — on top of the relentless scrutiny Kate’s been under since that unnecessary photoshopped image.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I do know this: She is in a unique position to be a much-needed voice for people around the world dealing with cancer at a young age. As a survivor of a gastrointestinal cancer, whose sufferers face much greater stigma than other types of cancer, I feel this most acutely. Kate is someone with a global public profile whose voice can truly make a difference in, for example, advocating for younger people to get colonoscopies and other cancer screenings. For the development of blood tests to detect gastrointestinal and other hard-to-detect cancers. And for health care providers to get on board with more modern practices, like the study that just found it’s unnecessary for people to starve themselves on a liquid diet the day before a colonoscopy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just celebrated my five-year cancerversary, which is to say I’ve been cancer-free since I finished a course of chemotherapy in February 2019. People ask me how I’m feeling now, and when I answer, I make sure to throw in details like “I’m definitely going to be advocating for more public restroom access from now on!” and “My digestive system will never be the same, but I’m happy to be alive!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe this makes me a Debbie Downer, but I’m fine with risking that to call attention to the fact that colon cancer survivors are often dealing with a very different version of “healthy” than the world might prefer to think about.\n",
      "\n",
      "Depending on the nature of her abdominal surgery, Kate might have been assigned a short-term or a permanent colostomy bag. If she was lucky enough not to, she’s very likely dealing with all kinds of abdominal distress nonetheless. And although I cannot stress enough that she owes absolutely nothing to the public while she goes through treatment, my fervent hope is that once she’s on the other side of it she’ll become a powerful voice advocating for more ways of early testing and destigmatization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having cancer is not elegant. It is not sophisticated. I’m sure it’s the kind of thing the royal family would rather never, ever think about. But it’s landed squarely in their midst regardless, so this is Kate’s chance to make a real difference in the health outcomes of countless people around the world.\n",

      "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Sunday defended accusing Israel of genocide against the Palestinian people and advocating for cuts to US military aid until humanitarian relief flows freely in Gaza. Her decision to use the term genocide, as she did during a floor speech on Friday in the House chamber, was “taken with extraordinary gravity,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "While she has openly condemned the violence in Gaza amid Israel’s war against Hamas, Ocasio-Cortez has typically been cautious about labeling Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians as genocide — a distinction in line with her tendency to use more conciliatory rhetoric on Israel than some of her ideological allies. But the escalating humanitarian crisis in Gaza has “crossed the threshold of intent,” Ocasio-Cortez told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As we speak, in this moment, 1.1 million innocents in Gaza are at famine’s door,” Ocasio-Cortez said in her speech Friday. “A famine that is being intentionally precipitated through the blocking of food and global humanitarian assistance by leaders in the Israeli government.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“What we are seeing here, I think, with a forced famine is beyond our ability to deny or explain away,” Ocasio-Cortez told Tapper. “There is no targeting of Hamas in precipitating a mass famine of a million people, half of whom are children.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“We have been clear in multiple conversations and in every way that any major military operation in Rafah would be a huge mistake. Let me tell you something, I have studied the maps. There’s nowhere for those folks to go,” she said on ABC’s “This Week.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Harris’ remarks come as national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant are set to meet at the White House on Monday. They are expected to focus on continued efforts to get the remaining hostages held by Hamas released and the urgent need for more humanitarian aid to reach civilians in Gaza.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on recent negotiations, Israel agreed to a US “bridging proposal” on the number of Palestinian prisoners to be released for every hostage held by Hamas, and the delegations are now waiting for a response from Hamas, CNN analyst Barak Ravid said Saturday on X, citing an unnamed senior Israeli official.\n",

      "“We are talking about famine,” she said. “The actions of Hamas should not be tied to whether a 3-year-old can eat. The actions of Hamas do not justify forcing thousands, hundreds of thousands of people to eat grass as their bodies consume themselves. We and the Israeli government have the right to go after Hamas. But we are talking about population of millions of innocent Palestinians. We’re talking about collective punishment, which is in unjustifiable,” she said.\n",

      "Leaked SpaceX documents show company forbids employees to sell stock if it deems they’ve misbehaved 'An act of dishonesty against the company' is among the violations cited\n",
      "\n",
      "SpaceX requires employees to agree to some unusual terms related to their stock awards, which have a chilling effect on staff, according to sources and internal documents viewed by TechCrunch.\n",
      "\n",
      "That includes a provision that allows SpaceX the right to purchase back vested shares within a six-month period following an employee leaving the company for any reason. SpaceX also gives itself the right to ban past and present employees from participating in tender offers if they are deemed to have committed “an act of dishonesty against the company” or to have violated written company policies, among other reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Employees often aren’t aware of the “dishonesty” condition when they initially sign up on the equity compensation management platform, one former employee said.\n",
      "\n",
      "If SpaceX bars an employee from selling stock in the tender offers, the person would have to wait until SpaceX goes public to realize cash from the shares — and it’s unclear when that will happen, if it ever does.\n",
      "\n",
      "SpaceX did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Employees pay taxes on their shares\n",
      "\n",
      "Like most tech companies, SpaceX includes stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) as part of its compensation package to attract top talent. No doubt this has paid off: SpaceX’s 13,000-strong workforce is helping to push the limits of what was thought possible in aerospace, including delivering crew to and from the International Space Station and building out the largest satellite constellation in history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike stock in public companies, stock in private companies cannot be sold without the company’s permission. So employees can only turn that part of their pay into cash when their employer allows such transactions. SpaceX is known for generally holding buyback events twice a year — meaning SpaceX will buy the shares back from employees; this schedule, which has been fairly reliable in recent years, means that employees have biannual opportunities to liquidate assets that have likely appreciated since the vesting date.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s not uncommon for additional terms to be attached to employee stock compensation at startups, and employees who stay with the company long enough to vest stock may have acquired stock under various stock plans with various conditions. Yet no employee at startups and private companies is entitled to sell their stock without their employer’s approval.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, at SpaceX, if an employee was fired “for cause,” the company stated it can repurchase their stock for a price of $0 per share, according to documents viewed by TechCrunch.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It sounds unusual to have [a] cause type exclusion provision in a tender offer agreement,” attorney and stock options expert Mary Russell told TechCrunch. She said it is also unusual for a traditional venture-based startup to have repurchase rights for vested shares that are unrelated to a bad-actor-type “for cause” termination.\n",
      "\n",
      "These terms “keep everyone under their control, even if they have left the company,” one former employee said, because employees don’t want to be forced to return their valuable SpaceX stock for no compensation. “And since there is no urgency by SpaceX to go public, being banned from tender offers effectively zeros out your shares, at least for a long time. Even though you paid thousands to cover the taxes.”\n",

      "SpaceX names Elon Musk actions as a “risk factor”\n",
      "\n",
      "As recently as 2020, SpaceX was also providing to employees a separate document outlining the risks of investing in the company’s securities. It reads similar to an S-1 registration statement that public companies must file; given that SpaceX is private, it is a unique disclosure into the company’s risk profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "To a large extent, such documents are written to minimize the company’s legal liability. The SpaceX document rightly points out that equity investments are inherently risky, because participants are trading a highly liquid asset — cash — for highly illiquid shares. As such, they exhaustively list various material risk factors, no matter how unlikely — for example, in its risk document, seen by TechCrunch, SpaceX includes that Hawthorne, California, which is home to its headquarters, is a “seismically active region.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The company also includes a number of risk factors related to Elon Musk, its CEO and founder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To date, the Company has been highly dependent on the leadership provided by the Company’s founder, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technical Officer, Elon Musk,” the document reads. “SpaceX, Mr. Musk, and other companies Mr. Musk is affiliated with, frequently receive an immense amount of media attention. As such, Mr. Musk’s actions or public statements could also potentially have a positive or negative impact on the market capitalization of SpaceX.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The document also calls out a $40 million settlement between Musk and the SEC, which came about after he tweeted in August 2018 that he was considering taking Tesla private. Even though that tweet did not relate to SpaceX, “the settlement has implications for SpaceX,” the document says.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If there is a lack of compliance with the settlement, additional enforcement actions or other legal proceedings could be instituted against Mr. Musk, which could have adverse consequences for SpaceX. Most notably, the SEC could deny SpaceX the right to rely on Regulation D, which is an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 for private financing transactions. A denial of future reliance on Regulation D could potentially make it more difficult for the Company to raise capital in the future.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While Tesla’s recent securities statements do call out the SEC settlement, they do not address potential media attention in the same direct manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The document also states that there is a risk that there may never be a public market for the company’s common stock — an issue should an employee ever be barred from tender events.\n",
      "\n",
      "SpaceX is one of the most valuable private companies in the world, with the valuation topping out at $180 billion as of last December. Like other private companies, its stock is split into preferred and common stock. Employees are awarded the latter, while preferred stock is generally owned by institutional investors and entities affiliated with Musk. Preferred stock has some superior rights attached to it, including liquidation preferences and dividends.\n",
      "\n",
      "The common stock is split into three stock classes: Class A, B and C. According to an equity incentive plan approved by the SpaceX board in March 2015, and which has a termination date in 2025, employees receive Class C stock, a non-voting stock.\n",

      "\n",
      "Irish Times political correspondent Jennifer Bray was given less than an hour’s notice of the surprise statement from the taoiseach on Wednesday. Bray told CNN that the resignation came as a “bolt from the blue for everyone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Gary Murphy, Professor of Politics at Dublin City University, said there was a “certain humility” to the speech, not typically associated with a politician often perceived to be “aloof” and “lacking the common touch.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Murphy said “a taoiseach resigning without any pressure from his party to do so is really unprecedented in the Irish state.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Even Varadkar seemed to be still catching his breath on Thursday afternoon when he told reporters gathered in Brussels for an EU leaders summit that the decision still hadn’t “sunk in.” He tried to dispel rumors that a scandal may be lurking on the horizon, stressing there was “no event” or “one thing” that prompted his resignation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite this, questions linger over the timing of his decision, less than three months out from local and European elections. His successor, largely tipped to be Higher Education Minister Simon Harris, will need to lead the center-right political party, Fine Gael, against a fired-up opposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A man in a hurry”\n",
      "\n",
      "Leo Varadkar has often been described by commentators as a “man in a hurry,” having scored the country’s top job after less than 10 years in politics. Following a short-lived career as a doctor, Varadkar rose rapidly to the top, cutting his teeth in high-profile jobs as health minister and transport minister.\n",
      "\n",
      "After he was appointed taoiseach in 2017, he quickly touted himself as a leader for the people “who get up early in the morning,” promising to bring financial prosperity and stability to Ireland in the wake of a devastating financial crash.\n",
      "\n",
      "And although opposition figures and some commentators branded him a “Thatcherite” proponent of neo-liberalism, Murphy insists Varadkar “never governed like that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“His administration, even before [the Covid-19 pandemic] wasn’t shy about spending public money, it was just that they got no political capital or credit,” Murphy said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Varadkar’s steady leadership during the pandemic was not something to be scoffed at, Murphy added. The Irish government took a more cautious approach to lockdown measures which, though at times unpopular, did culminate in significantly lower case numbers and death rates than its closest neighbor, the United Kingdom.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also scored a significant victory with his handling of the Brexit saga, Bray said, pointing towards his success in “breaking the deadlock around a no-deal Brexit” in 2019. His skill in handling former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson “did not resonate with the Irish public though, who wanted to hear less about Brexit and more about the solutions to what was a deepening housing and homelessness crisis,” according to Bray.\n",
      "\n",
      "Varadkar’s management of the housing crisis in particular will likely be the greatest mark on his legacy. Under both terms as taoiseach, the failure of his government to hit targets for affordable housing has left a generation of young voters unable to purchase homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under his tenure, Ireland did manage to shed some of the conservative societal norms propagated by the Catholic Church, through referendums legalizing same-sex marriage and lifting an abortion ban. This strong track record came to an end in early March, when a referendum to remove a constitutional reference to a woman’s place being in the home was resoundingly rejected, in a bruising defeat to Varadkar and his government.\n",
      "\n",
      "The “sheer scale” of the loss has “to have had an impact on his decision to go,” Murphy commented, saying Varadkar may have felt “some responsibility” for that.\n",

      "\n",
      "The 37-year-old who rose to prominence during his spell as health minister during the pandemic is considered by many to be a “mirror image” to Varadkar, Murphy said. A more affable and effective communicator however, Harris has built up a large online following through his frequent use of platforms such as Instagram and Tik Tok.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Simon Harris has promised to bring energy and vigor to the role, and Fine Gael will be hoping that he can connect them to an increasingly distant electorate: younger voters,” Bray said.\n",

The party, led by Mary Lou McDonald, has leveraged the government’s failure to tackle the housing issue in particular, promising the electorate that it has the policies to end the crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main question is whether Harris has “the political substance behind the polish,” Murphy added, saying his “big challenge” will be to present some ideas that “will catch the voters” ahead of the next general election, which must take place before March 2025.\n",

      "The Biden administration announced new automobile emissions standards Wednesday that officials called the most ambitious plan ever to cut planet-warming emissions from passenger vehicles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new rules relax initial tailpipe limits proposed last year but eventually get close to the same strict standards set out by the Environmental Protection Agency.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rules come as sales of electric vehicles, which are needed to meet the standards, have begun to slow. The auto industry cited lower sales growth in objecting to the EPA’s preferred standards unveiled last April as part of its ambitious plan to cut planet-warming emissions from passenger vehicles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The EPA said that under its final rule, the industry could meet the limits if 56% of new vehicle sales are electric by 2032, along with at least 13% plug-in hybrids or other partially electric cars, as well as more efficient gasoline-powered cars that get more miles to the gallon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new standards will avoid more than 7 billion tons of planet-warming carbon emissions over the next three decades and provide nearly $100 billion in annual net benefits, the EPA said, including lower health care costs, fewer deaths and more than $60 billion in reduced annual costs for fuel, maintenance and repairs.\n",

      "The EPA rule applies to model years 2027 to 2032 and will significantly reduce emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases, as well as other air pollution such as nitrogen oxides and particulate matter from new passenger cars, light trucks and pickups. The rule will help “tackle the climate crisis” and result in widespread reductions in air pollution while accelerating the adoption of cleaner vehicle technologies, the EPA said. The agency is finalizing the rule as sales of clean vehicles, including plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, hit record highs last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new rule slows implementation of stricter pollution standards from 2027 through 2029, after the auto industry called proposed benchmarks unworkable. The rule ramps up to nearly reach the level the EPA preferred by 2032.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let me be clear: Our final rule delivers the same, if not more, pollution reduction than we set out in our proposal,’’ EPA Administrator Michael Regan told reporters. In addition to carbon pollution, the final standards also will reduce other serious air pollution that contributes to heart attacks, respiratory illnesses, aggravated asthma and decreased lung function, Regan said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Folks, these new standards are so important for public health, for American jobs, for our economy and for our planet,’’ he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The standards are designed to be technology-neutral and performance-based, Regan said, giving car and truck manufacturers the flexibility to choose pollution-control technologies that are best suited for their customers while meeting environmental and public health goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The changes appear aimed at addressing strong industry opposition to the accelerated ramp-up of EVs, along with public reluctance to fully embrace the new technology. There is also a legitimate threat of legal challenges before conservative courts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Supreme Court, with a 6-3 conservative majority, has increasingly reined in the powers of federal agencies, including the EPA, in recent years. The justices have restricted the EPA’s authority to fight air and water pollution — including a landmark 2022 ruling that limited the EPA’s authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants that contribute to global warming.\n",
      "\n",
      "President Joe Biden has made fighting climate change a hallmark of his presidency and is seeking to slash carbon dioxide emissions from gasoline-powered vehicles, which make up the largest single source of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.\n",

      "At the same time, the Democratic president needs cooperation from the auto industry and political support from auto workers, a key political voting bloc.

      "Over an interview Denis Gursky, founding partner of 1991 Ventures, told me: “There is a wealth of untapped talent in Ukraine and Central and Eastern Europe… My brother, Viktor, and I want to create a pipeline of high-quality dealflow to that.”\n",

      "\n",
      "CNN —\n",
      "\n",
      "Justice was served this past week, a dozen years too late, when CJ Rice was legally exonerated by the Philadelphia district attorney’s office.\n",
      "\n",
      "The district attorney’s office dropped all charges against Rice for a 2011 shooting that sent him to prison for a crime he insists he did not — and was physically unable to — commit.\n",
      "\n",
      "CNN’s Jake Tapper, who covered Rice’s case on CNN and in a cover story in The Atlantic in 2022, has a new documentary airing Sunday on CNN at 8 p.m. ET examining Rice’s 2013 conviction, his ineffective counsel at trial, and the long and winding road it took to free him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tapper was alerted to Rice’s case because his pediatrician father, Dr. Theodore Tapper, treated Rice in 2011 five days before the shooting, when Rice could barely walk — much less run, as the shooters were described as having done — because he was recovering from a separate shooting at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tapper’s 2022 stories documented the many ways Rice’s attorney — an overworked, underpaid, court-appointed lawyer — made critical errors at trial, including failing to subpoena Rice’s cell phone location data, which might have provided an alibi, and allowing prosecutors to put forward to the jury a motive for the shooting that lacked evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "It took a high-powered team of attorneys and an exhaustion of the state’s appeals process for Rice’s case to finally get reconsidered by the judicial system last year through a successful federal petition for habeas corpus, a legal principle that allows people who believe they are being held unlawfully in prison to challenge their convictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advocates and lawyers say Rice’s cause was also aided by a district attorney willing to give a decade-old case an honest reexamination and a doctor who happened to have a journalist son and who remained troubled for years by the conviction of a patient he believed was not physically capable of committing the crime he was accused of.\n",
      "\n",
      "The events that led to the charges against Rice being tossed are a stark reminder that this (relatively) happy ending is very much the exception, not the rule, for those wrongfully convicted of crimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "A 1990s law and Supreme Court rulings in recent years have raised the bar even higher for successful habeas petitions, in which defendants have to correctly navigate a procedural labyrinth for the opportunity to prove their convictions were flawed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s too rare,” Karl Schwartz, Rice’s attorney on his habeas petition, said on CNN’s “The Lead” on Monday. “The limitations over the past decade or so that have been put on habeas proceedings and habeas representation makes it even rarer. And that’s really regrettable, especially with what we’ve learned about exculpatory evidence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A common problem in convictions later overturned\n",
      "\n",
      "Advocates and experts in habeas law and the post-trial appeals process say that cases where defendants receive ineffective counsel at trial are all too common.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to data from the National Registry of Exonerations, inadequate legal defense has been one of the factors in 27% of the nearly 3,500 exonerations since 1989. In Pennsylvania, it was a factor in 41% of exonerations, according to the registry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rice, who could not afford an attorney, was represented at his 2013 trial not by a public defender but by a court-appointed attorney, Sandjai Weaver, who received a flat fee for taking the case to trial — a system that advocates argue encourages underpaid attorneys to take too high a volume of cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the trial, Weaver failed to raise doubts about the lone eyewitness who named Rice, even though the testimony contained inconsistencies. There was no physical evidence tying Rice to the crime.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rice’s hospital records, which would have revealed he was dealing with a fractured pelvis in addition to recovering from surgery, weren’t obtained until years after his conviction, when Rice asked Dr. Tapper to retrieve them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“CJ and many others have court-appointed counsel that don’t get paid well, often can’t get the court to approve money for an investigator, have high caseloads,” said Nilam Sanghvi, the legal director of the Pennsylvania Innocence Project, who worked on Rice’s appeal. “It is a product of how the system is set up and then not funded.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Until recently, Pennsylvania was one of a few states that did not provide state-level funding to attorneys representing clients who cannot afford a lawyer. Instead, the system was funded at the county level. In December, the state legislature approved $7.5 million in funding, providing for the first time a revenue stream to bolster how counties currently pay for public defenders and court-appointed attorneys.\n",

      "\n",
      "C.J. Rice. Courtesy Crystal Cooper\n",
      "\n",
      "Rice’s first attempts to appeal his conviction in Pennsylvania were unsuccessful. But the initial attorney Rice had retained after Weaver made an important decision: raising Rice’s ineffective counsel in his first appeal through the state’s Post-Conviction Relief Act.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking that step allowed Rice to raise the ineffective counsel issue when he filed the federal habeas petition that was granted last year. Otherwise, he might not have been able to use that as an argument to get his case thrown out.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Pennsylvania, defendants can only raise ineffective assistance of counsel claims on their first post-conviction appeal under the PCRA law, said Amelia Maxfield, who worked on Rice’s case with the Pennsylvania Innocence Project and is now at the Exoneration Project.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When we get a case, and they’ve already exhausted their first PCRA — their counsel may be the worst attorney in the world and there’s almost no way we can bring that back into court,” Maxfield said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The state law also raises additional procedural requirements, including that an appeal has to be filed within a year of learning of new evidence, Maxfield said, which can foreclose possible challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rice’s cell phone data — which his first attorney, Weaver, had failed to subpoena — was deleted when Cricket Wireless was purchased by AT&T in 2014, as Tapper reported in 2022. But had the data somehow been retrieved, Maxfield said, it might not have qualified as new evidence under the law’s one-year requirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to procedural challenges, Rice faced a hurdle when it came to arguing the merits of his case: There was little evidence to challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The post-conviction system is actually premised on needing to produce new evidence. And if there’s weak evidence to begin with, it can be difficult,” Maxfield said.\n",
      "\n",
      "A federal system that’s made habeas challenges harder\n",
      "\n",
      "Rice’s attorneys filed a habeas corpus petition in federal court in 2022, after his state appeals had been exhausted. A year later, the appeal was granted by two federal judges. The case was sent back to the Philadelphia district attorney, who had 180 days to decide whether to retry Rice or drop the charges.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Monday, the district attorney’s office announced it was dropping the charges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rice’s habeas petition was granted on a specific claim: His attorney at trial incompetently agreed to allow evidence that provided a motive for the 2011 shooting.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The prosecution’s theory was that the shooting was retaliation against one of the victims for shooting Rice three weeks earlier. However, neither the police nor the prosecutor could offer any concrete evidence supporting the victim’s culpability for the earlier shooting, and the trial court was prepared to exclude the motive evidence for being more prejudicial than probative,” Schwartz wrote in the habeas petition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rice’s attorneys successfully argued that his constitutional rights had been violated by his ineffective counsel. But it’s rare for such a challenge to be successful: Tapper noted in his original Atlantic story that a 2007 study found habeas petitions are successful in just 0.3% of cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "The claims also have to have been made during the state appeals process; new evidence typically isn’t considered, Maxfield said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Congress and the Supreme Court have also raised the burden for habeas petitions over the past three decades.\n",
      "\n",
      "One year after the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, Congress passed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, or AEDPA. The new law added a one-year statute of limitations for habeas petitions to be made after a state appeals process ended, as well as a “deference” provision, meaning the federal court would grant a review only when the state court unreasonably applied established federal law, Ira Robbins, a professor of criminal law at American University Washington College of Law.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When all was said and done, AEDPA more than anything was a habeas corpus reform bill that severely increased the restrictions on writ of habeas corpus,” Robbins said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2022, the Supreme Court decision Shinn v. Ramirez added new restrictions on habeas petitions related to ineffective counsel, ruling that federal habeas petitions could not conduct evidentiary hearings beyond the state-court record based on ineffective assistance of state post-conviction counsel.\n",

      "A federal judge has dismissed a criminal indictment against seven Twitter users and a podcaster accused of running a $100 million stock manipulation scheme over social media.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Justice Department did not do enough to describe the influencers’ activities as a “scheme to defraud,” wrote District Judge Andrew Hanen of the US District Court for the Southern District of Texas, in an order dated Wednesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the indictment, the DOJ had alleged a lucrative “pump and dump” scheme in which the social media influencers used the messaging app Discord to promote certain stocks to their followers before selling their positions after a run-up in the stocks’ prices. The result was an alleged conspiracy by defendants “to unlawfully enrich themselves by pumping and dumping securities … through false and misleading posts and material omissions on Twitter [and Discord].”\n",
      "\n",
      "At least one of the defendants whose account CNN previously reviewed had tweeted about Gamestop and AMC, two so-called “meme stocks” that saw significant public interest and trading in 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Wednesday, however, Hanen wrote that while the defendants may well have intended to separate followers from their money, the evidence did not support a finding of actual securities fraud or conspiracy to commit fraud.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The key question is whether one statement by one of the co-defendants that ‘we’re robbing … idiots of their money,’ which is alleged in the Indictment, is sufficient,” the judge wrote. “This statement sufficiently alleges ‘intent to defraud’ … but does not on its own sufficiently allege that Defendants executed, or conspired to execute, a ‘scheme to defraud’ investors of money or property” as defined by court precedent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike a traditional fraud case, Hanen added, the DOJ merely claimed investors were deprived of relevant market information — not that the influencers directly stole money from investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The indictment was dismissed without prejudice, meaning charges could potentially be amended and refiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "The DOJ case is distinct from a civil suit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission around the same time against those same defendants and that accused them of violating US securities law.

      "\n",
      "Instead, his lawyers will get the chance to argue for a lengthy postponement and even a dismissal of the charges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Judge Juan Merchan is holding a pre-trial hearing in New York on Monday to discuss the discovery issues that led to the delay of the trial on charges brought by the Manhattan district attorney related to hush money payments until at least the middle of next month.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business documents related to the repayment of Michael Cohen for hush-money payments made before the 2016 election to cover up an alleged affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied the affair.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the trial starts in April, it would be the first of Trump’s four criminal trials to begin – and potentially the only one that would occur before the November election.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s what to know:\n",
      "\n",
      "What happened?\n",
      "\n",
      "The trial was postponed and Monday’s hearing was ordered after more than 100,000 new documents were turned over by the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, related to the 2018 prosecution of Trump’s former lawyer Cohen, who is a key witness in the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump’s lawyers say the new information is potentially exculpatory for the former president and they need at least 90 days to properly review the new material – a delay that fits with the former president’s overall efforts to delay all four criminal trials he’s facing until after the November election.\n",
      "\n",
      "Merchan said the trial postponement would be 30 days from the date of his letter, March 15, meaning the earliest the trial could start is April 15.\n",
      "\n",
      "The judge made clear that the hearing would only focus on the document production from the Southern District of New York, and not other issues such as the complaint from Trump’s lawyers that a new documentary about Daniels was intended to be released close to the start of trial to prejudice the jury pool.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the documents?\n",
      "\n",
      "The documents in question relate to the 2018 federal investigation into Cohen that led to charges on campaign finance violations and tax evasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bulk of the documents include records relied upon to obtain search warrants for Cohen’s devices and homes, including bank records. The US attorney’s office also turned over 30,000 pages related to documents seized from five iPhones and email accounts associated with Cohen.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, prosecutors said the US attorney’s office turned over FBI interview notes from special counsel Robert Mueller’s interviews with Cohen, which the office only received in December as a result of Freedom of Information Act litigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In all, more than 200,000 pages of records this month were handed over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why were the documents turned over so late?\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump’s attorneys and prosecutors are pointing fingers at one another over the reason the US attorney’s office did not turn over tens of thousands of documents until this month.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump’s team alleged that the district attorney was trying to hide exculpatory evidence ahead of the trial, and that the US attorney’s office only turned it over following a January subpoena from Trump’s attorneys.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the district attorney says that Trump’s attorneys are to blame for the delay. Prosecutors argue that Trump’s attorneys raised no issues with the document production made in July 2023 until six months later with the January subpoena.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The belated nature of the recent productions is entirely a result of defendant’s own inexplicable and strategic delay in identifying perceived deficiencies in the People’s disclosures and pursuing independent means to obtain that evidence,” prosecutors wrote in a filing.\n",
      "\n",
      "What happens next?\n",
      "\n",
      "The effort to dismiss the indictment is likely a long shot – Merchan has already rejected previous motions for dismissal.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the judge could signal on Monday whether he thinks the delay he put in place is long enough to go through the new documents – and whether he might block any testimony.\n",
      "\n",
      "Merchan, has already ruled that he would allow testimony from Cohen, rejecting a motion from Trump to prevent him from testifying because of credibility problems. And, he said Daniels could testify finding that she is part of the timeline.\n",

      "Intel is getting a huge boost from the US government under the CHIPS and Science Act. The company could get up to $8.5 billion in direct funding from the government, according to the preliminary agreement it has reached with the Department of Commerce. That money will go towards the chipmaker's efforts to expand its manufacturing facilities in the United States, particularly plants designed to make leading-edge semiconductor chips meant for use in AI and other advanced applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "The government's investment is expected to support Intel projects across four states, including the construction of two new leading-edge logic fabrication facilities and the modernization of another one in Chandler, Arizona, as well as the construction of two more fabs in New Albany, Ohio. It will also help Intel modernize two existing fabs in Rio Rancho, New Mexico and expand its facilities in Hillsboro, Oregon. The government's $8.5 billion funding will augment the company's $100 billion investment in US manufacturing over the next five years. And in case the company needs more money, it can borrow up to $11 billion from the US under the agreement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Biden administration signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law back in 2022 in hopes of fostering domestic semiconductor research and manufacturing and of lessening American companies' reliance in Chinese suppliers. This is the administration's fourth CHIPS investment, and it's largest yet. If you combine Intel's own money with the government's funding, this is one of the biggest investments announced in US semiconductor manufacturing overall. In February, the government also announced that it was granting GlobalFoundries with $1.5 billion in funding under the CHIPS Act to help the AMD spinoff build new fab facilities.\n",

      "Intel's projects in those aforementioned regions are expected to create 20,000 construction and 10,000 manufacturing jobs. To help ensure that the local population can benefit from those projects, the government will also earmark $50 million in dedicated funding to train and develop the local workforce. The parties have agreed to these terms under a preliminary agreement only, though, and the Department of Commerce might change them, depending on the results of a comprehensive due diligence process on the proposed projects and any future renegotiations.\n",

      "The hottest new technology for doctors promises to bring back an age-old health-care practice: face-to-face conversations with patients. As more than 30,000 health and tech professionals gathered among the palm trees at the HIMSS conference in Orlando, Florida, this week, ambient clinical documentation was the talk of the exhibition floor. This technology allows doctors to consensually record their visits with patients. The conversations are automatically transformed into clinical notes and summaries using artificial intelligence. Companies like Microsoft's Nuance Communications, Abridge and Suki have developed solutions with these capabilities, which they argue will help reduce doctors' administrative workloads and prioritize meaningful connections with patients. \"After I see a patient, I have to write notes, I have to place orders, I have to think about the patient summary,\" Dr. Shiv Rao, founder and CEO of Abridge, told CNBC at HIMSS. \"So what our technology does is it allows me to focus on the person in front of me — the most important person, the patient — because when I hit start, have a conversation, then hit stop, I can swivel my chair and within seconds, the note's there.\" Administrative workloads are a major problem for clinicians across the U.S. health-care system. A survey published by Athenahealth in February found that more than 90% of physicians report feeling burned out on a \"regular basis,\" largely because of the paperwork they are expected to complete. More than 60% of doctors said they feel overwhelmed by clerical requirements and work an average of 15 hours per week outside their normal hours to keep up, the survey said. Many in the industry call this at-home work \"pajama time.\" Since administrative work is mostly bureaucratic and doesn't directly influence doctors' decisions around diagnoses or patient care, it has served as one of the first areas where health systems have seriously begun to explore applications of generative AI. As a result, ambient clinical documentation solutions are having a real moment in the sun. \"There isn't a better place to be,\" Kenneth Harper, general manager of DAX Copilot at Microsoft, told CNBC in an interview. Microsoft's Nuance announced its ambient clinical documentation tool Dragon Ambient eXperience (DAX) Express in a preview capacity last March. By September, the solution, now called DAX Copilot, was generally available. Harper said there are now more than 200 organizations using the technology. Microsoft acquired Nuance for around $16 billion in 2021. The company had a two-story exhibition booth in the exhibit hall that was often packed with attendees Harper said the technology saves doctors several minutes per encounter, though the exact numbers vary depending on the specialty. He said his team gets feedback about the service almost daily from doctors who claim it has helped them take better care of themselves — and even saved their marriages.\n",
      "\n",
      "watch now\n",
      "\n",
      "Harper recounted a conversation with one physician who was considering retirement after practicing for more than three decades. He said the doctor was feeling worn out from years of stress, but he was inspired to keep working after he was introduced to DAX Copilot. \"He said, 'I literally think I'm going to practice for another 10 years because I actually enjoy what I do,'\" Harper said. \"That's just a personal anecdote of the type of impact this is having on our care teams.\" At HIMSS, Stanford Health Care announced it is deploying DAX Copilot across its entire enterprise. Gary Fritz, chief of applications at Stanford Health Care, said the organization had initially started by testing the tool within its exam rooms. He said Stanford recently surveyed physicians about their use of DAX Copilot and 96% found it easy to use. \"I don't know that I've ever seen that big a number,\" Fritz told CNBC in an interview. \"It is a big deal.\" Dr. Christopher Sharp, chief medical information officer at Stanford Health Care and one of the physicians who tested DAX Copilot, said it is \"remarkably seamless\" to use. He said the tool's immediacy and reliability are accurate and strong but could improve at capturing a patient's tone. Sharp said he thinks the tool saves him documentation time and has changed how he spends that time. He said he is often reading and editing notes instead of composing them, for instance, so it is not as though the work has disappeared entirely. In the near term, Sharp said he'd like to see more capabilities for personalization within DAX Copilot, both at an individual and specialty level. Even so, he said it was easy to see the value of it from the start. \"The moment that that first document returns to you, and you see your own words and the patient's own words being reflected directly back to you in a usable fashion, I would say that from that moment, you're hooked,\" Sharp told CNBC in an interview. Fritz said it is still early in the product life cycle, and Stanford Health Care is still working out exactly what deployment will look like. He said DAX Copilot will likely roll out in specialty-specific tranches.\n",

      "The end of the line could be near for New Jersey’s almighty political machine.\n",
      "\n",
      "A federal judge in Trenton is poised to rule as early as this week on a lawsuit aimed at kneecapping local bigwigs’ influence over party primaries and the nominating process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Democratic Senate candidate Andy Kim is asking the court for a preliminary injunction banishing the so-called party line – a ballot structure that allows county leaders to give preferential placement to their endorsed primary hopefuls. A ruling in the South Jersey congressman’s favor, though applicable only to the June primary, would – with the state’s off-year elections on the horizon – accelerate the unraveling of a system that has for decades allowed heavy-handed party bosses to dominate the makeup and character of New Jersey politics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fight for transparency and election fairness in the Garden State goes back more than a century. After some significant early wins for reformers, the balance of power shifted back to the machine over the course of the 20th century. By the time Donald Trump, the tabloid-star-turned-politician, came along in 2015, the system appeared to be hardened in its favor.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Trump’s ascent to the presidency, even in a state that he lost by more than half a million votes in 2016, triggered a grassroots revolt that eventually put the “party line” in the crosshairs of good government advocates. The “pro-democracy” agenda embraced by President Joe Biden and national Democrats after the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol brought the issue further into the mainstream. Kim’s lawsuit, nearly a carbon copy of one originally filed three years ago, is attracting national attention because of his looming primary against New Jersey first lady and first-time candidate Tammy Murphy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kim and Murphy, among others, are vying to replace Sen. Bob Menendez, the longtime Democratic incumbent now facing a thick and colorful assortment of corruption charges that could land him in prison for years. Menendez announced Thursday that he would not run for reelection in the Democratic primary but again left open the possibility of an independent bid this summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tammy Murphy, the wife of two-term Gov. Phil Murphy, entered the primary in November, about two months after Kim. Her arrival was greeted with a flood of endorsements, several of which either guaranteed or strongly suggested she would be given a plum spot on the primary ballot – and a potentially decisive advantage over Kim before the campaign had begun in earnest.\n",

      "\n",
      "The tipping point\n",
      "\n",
      "Murphy’s decision to seek the seat, and the speed with which local pooh-bahs lined up behind her, triggered what could be a generational realignment in a state historically dominated by powerful party bosses in the way that many Americans associate with a bygone era – recalling New York’s Tammany Hall of the mid-19th century.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those structures largely came apart elsewhere over the past few decades, but New Jersey Democratic leaders have retained their unique influence thanks in large part to “the line,” a shorthand for the prized ballot real estate controlled by county party officials, many of whom are themselves unelected.\n",
      "\n",
      "The practice places the names of party-backed candidates for a variety of offices in a single, prominent column. Those who do not receive a place on “the line” are scattered across the ballot, marooned in what is often referred to as “Ballot Siberia.” Reform advocates and progressive Democratic groups operating outside the good graces of entrenched leadership have long railed against the practice, calling it anti-democratic and tantamount to voter suppression.\n",
      "\n",
      "For decades, though, “the line” existed without a serious challenge. The risks for dissenters was too high and, by its nature, the process successfully froze out critics who might want to run for office and seek change from within. The broader chilling effect largely zeroed out criticism even among minor players.\n",

      "But the explosion of grassroots liberal engagement following Trump’s election – a shock to the system that ignited a wave of new interest that echoed the post-Watergate push for good government laws – emboldened “line” opponents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frustrated, anxious and angry, the Democratic grassroots across the country revolted at every level of government, mixing intense lobbying of federal lawmakers with a surge in outsider candidacies for down-ballot offices. Groups such as Indivisible, with its hyper-engaged local chapters – many stocked with middle-aged, upper-middle-class, first-time political activists – began to question everything from party strategy to the arcane institutional processes that had operated for so long with a minimum of oversight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The fight against the county line and the political machines really goes back to the election of Trump, when it picked up serious speed,” said Rutgers professor Julia Sass Rubin, who testified in Kim’s lawsuit and has conducted extensive research on the line’s outsize influence. “There were a number of grassroots organizations that formed, we saw this nationally, especially started by women.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Rubin said it was not until Murphy announced her Senate run, and immediately received broad backing from New Jersey Democratic leaders, that the issue exploded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Tammy Murphy-Andy Kim race has put (the issue) on steroids. It has really amplified general public awareness, which was building. But it was building among the aware, kind of progressive grassroots,” Rubin said. “This brought it into the mainstream in a big way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Following Trump’s election, rank-and-file liberals in New Jersey – like many other largely Democratic states – rushed to enmesh themselves in local politics. But their ambitions were mostly thwarted. Though New Jersey Democrats picked up US House seats in the 2018 midterms, the state seemed immune to an explosion of political insurgencies, typified not only by the rise of “The Squad” but also the ascent of younger female and minority candidates who sought to wrest power from what they viewed as an indifferent, self-serving establishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The (Democratic newcomers) thought they were on the right team here and thought because they were Democrats, they had the ability to stand up and say proudly that they’re the party for democracy, especially in light of Trump being president,” said longtime progressive activist Sue Altman, a Democratic candidate for the state’s 7th Congressional District. But that initial optimism was blunted when “they found out that at the local level or the city level or the county level or the state legislative level, that their own beloved Democrats were not practicing ‘little d’ democracy,” Altman said.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The line’ as ballast against the liberal grassroots\n",
      "\n",
      "The complications facing would-be reformers in New Jersey were initially underscored by the state party’s lack of political turmoil. Though hardly a machine choice, wealthy former Goldman Sachs executive and Democratic National Committee finance chair Phil Murphy won the governor’s office in 2017.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the next few years, as political insurgents like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, across the river in New York, and Cori Bush in Missouri unseated longtime Democratic incumbents in races up and down the ballot, progressive groups largely bypassed New Jersey. The state’s expensive media market and the bureaucratic barriers facing outsider campaigns made it an unwise place to spend precious resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is extremely difficult to engage in any kind of competitive primaries in New Jersey because at the end of the day, the winners are likely going to be chosen by the establishment,” said Ezra Levin, the co-founder and co-executive director of Indivisible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indivisible does not, like more confrontational groups including Justice Democrats, typically get involved in fraught primary fights. Their membership, Levin said, is engaged on multiple policy fronts, from health care to immigration, “but the very top issue that they care about is democracy itself – this feeling that it was under threat and this sense that the Democratic Party when Trump got elected was not equipped to take on that threat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin says that for Indivisible groups, the battle in New Jersey over “the line” is not about a preference between Kim or Murphy, though the organization has endorsed Kim.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When I’m talking to our advocates, I will always say that the enemy isn’t MAGA, the enemy is cynicism and nihilism and fatalism,” Levin said. “Corrupt systems like the ‘county line’ in New Jersey (is) an enemy because that dissuades folks from actually getting involved. And if folks don’t get involved, then we’ll lose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As the Murphy-Kim race has heated up, interest in ending – or, among party leaders, defending – “the line” has also increased in size and intensity. A 2021 lawsuit, brought by and supported by a coalition of progressive Democrats, including Altman and the New Jersey Working Families Alliance, has been wending its way through the court system for years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kim speaks to delegates during the Bergen County Democratic convention in Paramus, New Jersey, on March 4, 2024. Seth Wenig/AP\n",
      "\n",
      "But for Kim, there was no time to waste. He effectively took up the old litigation late last month, using the same lawyers, in a bid to redesign the ballots before the June 4 primary. His request of the court, simply put, is for a federal judge to order that New Jersey follow all other states and group together candidates for any given office.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Monday, Kim testified in US District Judge Zahid Quraishi’s courtroom that he believed the current process “to be averse to the pursuit of democracy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m not asking for any advantage for me,” Kim told the court. “All I’m asking for is for New Jersey to be in line with 49 other states in terms of pursuing an office block-style ballot that would allow us to have a fairer system here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Kim has also won some county lines in this primary, and appeared on them during his own past races, the third-term congressman argued that a fundamentally unjust institution compelled him to play ball.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Despite my personal concerns about how this went,” Kim said, “I felt I had no choice but to participate in the system.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Murphy campaign took a dimmer view of Kim’s motivations.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Unfortunately, Congressman Kim’s focus has been on personal attacks and process,” said Murphy spokesperson Alexandra Altman, who has previously dismissed the lawsuit as a “hypocritical stunt.”\n",

      "New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy talks to reporters at the Bergen County Democratic convention in Paramus on March 4, 2024. Seth Wenig/AP\n",
      "\n",
      "Kim campaign spokesperson Katey Sabo disputed that characterization, calling the line’s potential undoing “a critical issue in protecting our democracy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The arguments against redrawing the ballots, at least in this case and the current discourse, are less high-minded, with the defendants in the suit – clerks from the 19 counties with county line ballots – contending that the changes sought by the plaintiff, Kim, would be too difficult to implement this late in the campaign-election calendar. (Ballots are printed and mailed out well before the June 4 primary date.)\n",
      "\n",
      "A ruling is expected in the coming days or weeks. Tammy Murphy, who is not involved in the case, has said she will follow the rules, regardless of the outcome. Altman, her spokesperson, told CNN that Kim’s strategy “does not help the real New Jerseyans struggling to make ends meet or protect their reproductive rights from being stripped away.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Days of chaos\n",
      "\n",
      "No matter how the judge decides in Kim’s last-ditch bid, “the line” appears to be on borrowed time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ahead of the hearing last week, New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin announced in a letter to the court that he would not defend the “challenged statutes,” calling them “unconstitutional.” He will also drop out of the 2021 case, which remains in the judicial pipeline, after initially defending “the line.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The governor, under whom Platkin served as general counsel before being appointed to his current post, publicly disagreed with his longtime political ally, saying a defense of the system “would have been appropriate and consistent with the actions” of Platkin’s predecessors.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Outside the context of any campaign, Governor Murphy has consistently and accurately noted that the bracketing of candidates is permitted by duly enacted laws that have been on the books for decades,” Murphy spokesman Mahen Gunaratna told CNN. “It is well-established that Attorneys General have a general obligation to defend the constitutionality of statutes, regardless of their own personal views.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That dust-up followed a weekend in which Kim had secured the backing of Democrats in Morris and Atlantic counties – where the process isn’t as tightly controlled by party leadership. In Camden County, where the local boss keeps a tighter grip, video of another Senate candidate, progressive Patricia Campos-Medina, being blocked from entering the county Democratic convention went viral.\n",
      "\n",
      "Around the time Platkin’s memo went out, the Hoboken Democrats – who operate under the powerful Hudson County Democratic Organization, whose leader backed Tammy Murphy immediately upon her entering the race – announced that their own process had yielded a landslide victory for Kim. Moments later, Hoboken Democratic Committee Chair Rachel Hodes announced her resignation, alleging harassment by Murphy allies and a “gross rejection of democracy” by the county group.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Since we announced this (endorsement) meeting, I began receiving calls and emails denigrating and diminishing the integrity of our process,” Hodes wrote. “Multiple senior advisors on the Tammy Murphy campaign called me to coerce me into changing our process, essentially calling it a sham.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Both sides have acknowledged that a key sticking point was the Hoboken Democrats’ decision to solicit written statements from the candidates rather than inviting them to deliver their message in person. (Candidates were allowed to make more direct appeals to Hoboken committee voters.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The train kept rolling on Monday morning when, shortly before the federal court hearing began, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop, who is running to succeed Phil Murphy as governor in 2025, switched sides in the Senate primary and backed Kim.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s no secret I’ve been disappointed with the (Tammy Murphy) campaign and how it has been conducted,” Fulop said in a statement, which also suggested the first lady consider bowing out of the race. “I’ve expressed that over the last two months repeatedly both privately and publicly, and at this point, it’s clear to me that I was wrong with my early support and endorsement of Tammy Murphy for Senate.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The growing backlash among ambitious officials underscored the rapidly changing tides of public opinion – and awareness. On Wednesday, in another sign of concern among brass from both parties (New Jersey Republicans also employ “the line” in their primaries), state Senate and Assembly leaders announced they would begin “a public process on ballot design in New Jersey, including a thorough and thoughtful review of other states, as well as a process that involves input from the public.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But their statement also echoed other supporters of “the line,” insisting that the legislature – and not the courts – keep “the authority to determine the law regarding ballot design and the appropriate discretion used by county clerks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are prepared to work in a bipartisan manner to ensure public trust in a transparent and democratic process in New Jersey,” the leadership quartet said.\n",
      "\n",

      "Trump has so far managed to use his indictments and court appearances to fuel his campaign, railing against what he claims is an establishment out to get him. For all the free airtime that the legal challenges have provided, however, the overall costs are starting to add up — and the financial penalties might just end up being more damaging than the criminal charges.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Trump has a narrow lead over President Joe Biden in the polls, the efforts to hold Trump accountable in the eyes of the law, and the financial judgments and hefty legal fees that come with them, could potentially take a devastating toll on his campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most important thing at the moment is money — and the problem for Trump is that as his legal expenses and obligations are piling up, his fundraising efforts have been lagging. His leadership political action committee, Save America, spent nearly $5.6 million in legal fees in February alone. And while the super PAC Maga Inc. has refunded nearly all of that money, that’s money that could have been used for Trump’s campaign. (In total, Maga Inc. has refunded more than $52 million to Save America.)\n",
      "\n",
      "It doesn’t help that there is a growing fundraising gap between Trump and Biden. Right now, President Biden’s campaign coffers are overflowing. According to recent Federal Election Commission filings, the president had $71 million in available cash in his principal campaign account at the end of February, compared to Trump’s campaign, which reported $33.5 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a campaign where a relatively small percentage of swing voters in a handful of states will likely determine the outcome, turnout and advertising buys will have an outsized impact. Biden’s financial strength has allowed his campaign to unleash a torrent of blistering ads in swing states, targeting core voters such as Latinos. Democrats have also demonstrated that their campaign infrastructure is strong, as was evident in the 2018 and 2022 midterm elections, as well as special elections in 2023 and 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump, meanwhile, is desperately playing catch-up and could run into additional problems with fundraising over time, as he tries to persuade donors to give him more. It’s likely that big-ticket supporters would rather back a campaign for the next president than fund a collective bailout.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there is the whopping $355 million, not counting interest, that Trump has been ordered to pay in the New York civil fraud case. After getting an insurance company to underwrite the $91.6 million bond to appeal the $83 million judgement in the E Jean Carroll defamation case, Trump is struggling to come up with another massive bond. Sources told CNN that Trump is going into panic mode ahead of the March 25 deadline before New York Attorney General Letitia James can start to collect on the judgment, and the potential threat to his real estate holdings and financial empire are serious. If there is one thing that really gets to Trump, it is any threat to his wealth. That threat is now front and center.\n",
      "\n",
      "None of this is to say Trump isn’t in a strong position less than eight months out from the election — he is. His takeover of the Republican National Committee is an important step that will help reinvigorate his fundraising operations. His ability to garner free television news coverage, in part because of the trials, should not be underestimated. And his ability to draw money from small donors from a loyal fan base remains formidable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump might also be looking at a windfall, given that investors approved a deal Friday to merge Trump Media with a blank-check company. The new entity, Trump Media & Technology Group, will trade on the stock market under the ticker DJT, with Trump’s shares worth more than $3 billion at current market prices.\n",

      "“Today, we’re setting new pollution standards for cars and trucks,” President Biden said in a statement. “US workers will lead the world on autos making clean cars and trucks, each stamped ‘Made in America.’ You have my word.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The emissions rules set performance standards based on grams of greenhouse gases per mile, but they don’t require automakers to sell EVs. In fact, administration officials insisted the standards were “technologically neutral,” acknowledging that hybrid vehicles will also help meet the targets. Still, requiring steeper cuts in emissions would essentially force the auto industry to sell more EVs in order to comply with the standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think what you see in the final rule is increased flexibility that still delivers massive gains for public health and for the environment,” Ali Zaidi, the White House’s climate advisor, told The Verge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the final rules, light-duty vehicles (passenger vehicles like sedans, SUVs, and trucks) would be required to hit an industry-wide target of 85 grams of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per mile by 2032, down from 170 grams / mile in 2027. For medium-duty vehicles (big trucks and vans), the EPA is mandating a 44 percent reduction in GHG emissions to 274 grams / mile in 2032 from 461 grams / mile in 2027.\n",
      "\n",
      "The EPA says that the new standards will result in a reduction of 7.2 billion metric tons of harmful carbon dioxide emissions over the life of the program and approximately $13 billion in health benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For the person who thinks, ‘Gee, is my country doing what it needs to do to step up at this moment of crisis and lead by example?’” Zaidi said. “The answer is yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But environmental groups have warned that more aggressive action is needed to tackle climate change. The transportation sector, which includes privately owned vehicles, accounts for over a quarter of all planet-heating emissions spewed into the atmosphere globally. In the lead-up to the announcement, climate activists urged the White House to reject the auto industry’s push for slower implementation and adopt the stricter standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "The planet has gotten about 1.2 degrees Celsius hotter since the Industrial Revolution, and that’s already been enough to cause more extreme weather, intensify wildfires, and raise sea levels high enough to push coastal communities away from their homes. To keep those kinds of disasters from getting much worse, the Paris agreement seeks to limit warming to around 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the slowdown in EV sales growth proved to be more influential, as well as lobbying by the United Auto Workers, which recently endorsed President Biden’s bid for reelection. EV sales grew 47 percent over 2023 to reach nearly 8 percent of all vehicles sold. But that growth slowed in the final months of the year and into 2024, as high prices and concerns about charging turned some customers away. Meanwhile, hybrid sales grew at a faster rate than battery-electric vehicles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slowing down the timeline “was the right call,” said John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the industry’s main lobbying group, in a statement. “These adjusted EV targets – still a stretch goal – should give the market and supply chains a chance to catch up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The administration is hoping that these emissions rules, combined with financial incentives included in the Inflation Reduction Act, the president’s signature climate initiative, will help pave the way for greater adoption of electric vehicles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The political jockeying over emissions rules has been intense over the past several administrations. After he was elected in 2016, Donald Trump rolled back emissions standards put in place by Barack Obama, making it easier for automakers to produce polluting cars. But Biden reversed the rollback soon after coming into office.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the Biden administration, these rules represent a central pillar in the president’s climate goals. Right after taking office, Biden signed an executive order laying out his vision for half of all new car sales to be tailpipe emissions-free by 2030.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there have also been delays. The EPA said recently it wouldn’t finalize its rules for emissions from gas-fired power plants in the US until after the November election, teeing up a scenario in which the rules are left unchanged if Biden loses his reelection bid to Donald Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump has zeroed in on electric vehicles as a potential wedge issue, portraying them as expensive, hard to charge, and unpopular with most Americans. But the White House insists that the new standards will ensure that consumers still have choices when selecting a new vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The bottom line is, this shows that leadership matters,” Zaidi said. “President Biden has prioritized public health, he’s prioritized environmental protection, he’s prioritized tackling the climate crisis, and he’s prioritized consumer savings.”\n",

So the ACP helps bridge that price gap for consumers while also benefiting internet providers, many of whom say the program ensures a base of demand to support building in otherwise money-losing markets.\n",

      "“I can think of lots of examples where we’re boring under a river to get to two customers, and that was extremely costly,” said Gary Johnson, CEO and general manager of Paul Bunyan Communications, a Minnesota-based telecom cooperative serving some of the furthest reaches of the state. “To get fiber in the most rocky areas, we’re literally using a rock saw and we’re cutting, slicing a path through that rock so we can put our fiber cable in. The fact you’re dividing that [cost] over a very small number of customers? That’s ultimately challenging.”\n",

They tried a series of side hustles — a denim line, collage kits, writing and selling a book — but none were particularly lucrative, and the products took up too much space in their 250-square-foot studio apartment. At the time, Herrmann was a full-time software developer. Barton was a freelance photographer and burgeoning influencer. They turned to an idea that used both of their skillsets: making and selling photo filters on Adobe Lightroom. Over several weeks, the filters gained an audience, prompting the pair to launch their own photo-editing app called Tezza — Barton's nickname since college, she says — in 2018. DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to earning passive income online Today, Tezza is a lifestyle brand that combines most of the couple's side hustle attempts — selling collage kits, apparel and a recently launched magazine, in addition to its flagship photo and video editing app. The Los Angeles-based company brought in $26.5 million in sales last year, or $2.2 million per month on average, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It. \"We started this without the intention of it becoming a business,\" says Herrmann. \"It really started as a passion project, a way for us to hopefully get some extra income to pay rent and survive in New York City.\"\n",

Eventually, brands like Urban Outfitters and Free People — both owned by parent company URBN — reached out, offering to pay her to plan shoots around their products. By the time she and Herrmann moved to New York in 2016, she'd amassed roughly 20,000 followers on social media, she says. Publicly, the couple's lifestyle was highly aspirational. Behind the scenes, they worked unglamorous hours for 18 months to stay afloat while building their app. \"We were building it, probably, from the hours of 10 p.m. to 3 a.m.,\" says Barton, adding: \"It was a lot of tears and trial and error and thinking, 'OK, this is a dumb idea. It's never going to work.' Because we couldn't really get it [to work] for a long time. It was a struggle.\"\n",

Instead, Tezza went bold. Its photo editing features were simple. The app's bright red design featured chunky fonts and used casual millennial slang to connect to its audience.

So we’re going to have put our foot down on it a bit,” said Midjourney CEO David Holz at a press gathering on March 13. Midjourney floated the idea of banning such prompts last month. Holz told members of the press that he envisions an even more frightening AI reality in 2028, with bad actors being able to more finely tune deepfakes and chatbots than we can even imagine now. To that end, he said, \"this moderation stuff is kind of hard.\"\n",

      "In addition to colder weather, January welcomed the beginnings of new, scheduled drama programming, which accounted for a 20% increase in viewing on broadcast networks. NBC’s Chicago franchise (Chicago Fire, Chicago Med, Chicago P.D.) led the way, representing some of the first “new” scripted content of the broadcast TV season. Combined with a 36% rise in sports viewing, broadcast was able to grow its share of TV by 0.7 share points to end the month at 24.2% of TV. With the arrival of new programming still somewhat limited, however, broadcast viewing was down 20% compared with a year ago.\n",

Comparatively, news viewing picked up, accounting for 19% of overall cable usage, with the Iowa Town Hall on Fox News Channel becoming the only non-sports program to land in the top 10 cable broadcasts (excluding sports commentary).

      "Prime Minister Leo Varadkar sent shockwaves through Ireland when he candidly announced he was “no longer the best person” to lead his country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The taoiseach took journalists, opposition lawmakers and even members of his own government by surprise with his decision to step down for what he called “personal” but “mainly political” reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 45-year-old had become a familiar face on the international stage, having made headlines in 2017 when aged 38 he became the youngest prime minister in Irish history. Ireland’s first gay, mixed race leader soon became the face of a new and more liberal Ireland, shepherding in progressive social change through a string of successful referendums.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had taken up the role of taoiseach again in December 2022 as part of a job rotation agreed by the coalition government formed after the 2020 general election.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent weeks, Varadkar had drawn praise for his solidarity with the people of Gaza, challenging President Joe Biden over sustained US support for Israel during a stateside visit last week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Irish Times political correspondent Jennifer Bray was given less than an hour’s notice of the surprise statement from the taoiseach on Wednesday. Bray told CNN that the resignation came as a “bolt from the blue for everyone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Gary Murphy, Professor of Politics at Dublin City University, said there was a “certain humility” to the speech, not typically associated with a politician often perceived to be “aloof” and “lacking the common touch.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Murphy said “a taoiseach resigning without any pressure from his party to do so is really unprecedented in the Irish state.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Even Varadkar seemed to be still catching his breath on Thursday afternoon when he told reporters gathered in Brussels for an EU leaders summit that the decision still hadn’t “sunk in.” He tried to dispel rumors that a scandal may be lurking on the horizon, stressing there was “no event” or “one thing” that prompted his resignation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite this, questions linger over the timing of his decision, less than three months out from local and European elections. His successor, largely tipped to be Higher Education Minister Simon Harris, will need to lead the center-right political party, Fine Gael, against a fired-up opposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A man in a hurry”\n",
      "\n",
      "Leo Varadkar has often been described by commentators as a “man in a hurry,” having scored the country’s top job after less than 10 years in politics. Following a short-lived career as a doctor, Varadkar rose rapidly to the top, cutting his teeth in high-profile jobs as health minister and transport minister.\n",
      "\n",
      "After he was appointed taoiseach in 2017, he quickly touted himself as a leader for the people “who get up early in the morning,” promising to bring financial prosperity and stability to Ireland in the wake of a devastating financial crash.\n",
      "\n",
      "And although opposition figures and some commentators branded him a “Thatcherite” proponent of neo-liberalism, Murphy insists Varadkar “never governed like that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“His administration, even before [the Covid-19 pandemic] wasn’t shy about spending public money, it was just that they got no political capital or credit,” Murphy said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Varadkar’s steady leadership during the pandemic was not something to be scoffed at, Murphy added. The Irish government took a more cautious approach to lockdown measures which, though at times unpopular, did culminate in significantly lower case numbers and death rates than its closest neighbor, the United Kingdom.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also scored a significant victory with his handling of the Brexit saga, Bray said, pointing towards his success in “breaking the deadlock around a no-deal Brexit” in 2019. His skill in handling former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson “did not resonate with the Irish public though, who wanted to hear less about Brexit and more about the solutions to what was a deepening housing and homelessness crisis,” according to Bray.\n",
      "\n",
      "Varadkar’s management of the housing crisis in particular will likely be the greatest mark on his legacy. Under both terms as taoiseach, the failure of his government to hit targets for affordable housing has left a generation of young voters unable to purchase homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under his tenure, Ireland did manage to shed some of the conservative societal norms propagated by the Catholic Church, through referendums legalizing same-sex marriage and lifting an abortion ban. This strong track record came to an end in early March, when a referendum to remove a constitutional reference to a woman’s place being in the home was resoundingly rejected, in a bruising defeat to Varadkar and his government.\n",
      "\n",
      "The “sheer scale” of the loss has “to have had an impact on his decision to go,” Murphy commented, saying Varadkar may have felt “some responsibility” for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "A social media savvy successor\n",

      "Ireland's Minister for Further and Higher Education, Simon Harris, announced on Friday that he will run to become Fine Gael leader. Nick Bradshaw/PA/Alamy/Sipa\n",
      "\n",
      "As several political heavyweights, including finance minister and Eurogroup chairman Paschal Donohoe, declined to throw their hat in the ring, the stage is set now for Simon Harris to become the next taoiseach.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 37-year-old who rose to prominence during his spell as health minister during the pandemic is considered by many to be a “mirror image” to Varadkar, Murphy said. A more affable and effective communicator however, Harris has built up a large online following through his frequent use of platforms such as Instagram and Tik Tok.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Simon Harris has promised to bring energy and vigor to the role, and Fine Gael will be hoping that he can connect them to an increasingly distant electorate: younger voters,” Bray said.\n",

The party, led by Mary Lou McDonald, has leveraged the government’s failure to tackle the housing issue in particular, promising the electorate that it has the policies to end the crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main question is whether Harris has “the political substance behind the polish,” Murphy added, saying his “big challenge” will be to present some ideas that “will catch the voters” ahead of the next general election, which must take place before March 2025.\n",

      "The panel's vote to recommend spring boosters for older adults is not final until CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen signs off on it. She does not have to follow the committee's advice, but usually does. An official CDC recommendation is needed for health insurance providers to cover the additional dose.\n",
      "\n",

      "\"This gives us a great opportunity to remind people about the importance of vaccination,\" said Marvia Jones, director of the Kansas City Health Department in Missouri, who was not involved in Wednesday's ACIP meeting. \"We certainly are concerned about the vulnerability of people in that age group when it comes to Covid-19.\"\n",

      "The nation’s largest credit union said this week that an external review found it hadn’t considered race in mortgage underwriting, responding to CNN’s previous reporting about racial gaps in its mortgage approval rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Navy Federal Credit Union, which has more than 13 million members and lends to military servicemembers, Department of Defense personnel, veterans and their families, said a review it commissioned from a civil rights lawyer “found no race-based decision making in our mortgage underwriting” and that “legitimate, non-race factors” had largely explained racial differences in approval rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "A CNN investigation published in December found that Navy Federal approved more than 75% of the White borrowers who applied for a new conventional home purchase mortgage in 2022 while approving less than 50% of Black borrowers who applied for the same type of loan, according to the most recent federal data available from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nearly 29-percentage-point gap in Navy Federal’s approval rates was the widest of any of the 50 lenders that originated the most mortgage loans in 2022. The disparity remained even after accounting for more than a dozen different variables available in public mortgage data, including applicants’ income, debt-to-income ratio and property value, CNN’s review found.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, an analysis by staff of the Senate Banking Committee, which 10 Democratic senators cited in a letter asking federal regulators to review Navy Federal’s mortgage lending earlier this year, also found racial disparities in Navy Federal’s mortgage approval rates based on the publicly available data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Navy Federal said Thursday that an analysis it had commissioned by lawyer Debo Adegbile, a former member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, found that those racial disparities were largely accounted for by examining “all non-public underwriting factors.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our review found that when all relevant factors are controlled for, which CNN did not do, the difference in approval rates between Black and White borrowers falls to less than 1%,” Adegbile said in a statement. “The remaining difference in approval rates is explained by legitimate, non-race factors like income verification and incomplete credit applications.” The analysis also accounted for other non-public factors including applicants’ credit scores, the statement said.\n",
      "\n",
      "A spokesperson for Navy Federal did not respond to a request for additional details about the analysis.\n",

      "\n",
      "CNN’s analysis only included mortgage applications that were listed in the public data as being fully submitted and either approved or denied, and excluded those that were listed as “closed for incompleteness.” And while Navy Federal’s statement said its analysis included applicants’ debt-to-income ratios, CNN’s review also took those ratios, which are available in the public mortgage data, into account.\n",
      "\n",
      "Navy Federal described Adegbile’s analysis as an “external review,” but his law firm, WilmerHale, is also defending Navy Federal in a class-action lawsuit from Black and Latino borrowers who allege the credit union discriminated against them in mortgage applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same day that Navy Federal released a statement about the review, other lawyers from WilmerHale filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which had cited CNN’s reporting. Attorneys for the credit union argued that the “alleged statistical disparities” the plaintiffs had cited were not sufficient to prove discrimination, and that they “fail to identify any Navy Federal policy or practice that caused any disparity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The lawyers also argued that agreements the plaintiffs had signed when they became members of the credit union had required them to give Navy Federal adequate notice before filing a lawsuit, and that most had not done so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adegbile’s analysis was not included in Navy Federal’s motion to dismiss the case.\n",

      "“Navy Federal should immediately put out the full investigative report and data analysis so that Navy Federal’s members have an opportunity for themselves to review the findings,” the statement said.\n",

Its recovery won’t begin until management starts examining how the company got here.”\n",

Joann, “founded 81 years ago when my seamstress grandmothers still had young children at home, blamed a post-pandemic sales slump for the downturn.

      "\n",
      "To take advantage of homeowner tax deductions, you'll need to itemize your deductions using Form 1040 Schedule A.

It's also often the most lucrative, particularly for new homeowners whose payments generally go more toward loan interest during the first years of a mortgage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Homeowners filing taxes jointly and single tax filers can deduct all payments for mortgage interest on the first $750,000 of their mortgage debt, or mortgage debt up to $1,000,000 if you're deducting mortgage interest from before Dec. 15, 2017. If you file married separately, you can deduct half those amounts -- $375,000 or $500,000, respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "To deduct your mortgage interest, you'll need to fill out IRS Form 1098, which you should receive from your lender in early 2024. You can then enter the amount from Line 1 on that Form 1098 into Line 8 of 1040 Schedule A.\n",

Each 1% of the mortgage amount that home buyers pay on top of their down payment generally reduces their interest rate by 0.25%, though the exact amount will depend on the lender and the loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Discount points can save you big money on a 30-year mortgage by lowering the total interest you'll have to pay across decades, but they can also save you money on your taxes when you buy them.

      "Within hours of the Russian invasion in February 2022, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky invoked martial law across the country, setting in motion an ongoing defence operation and signing a decree to mobilize conscripts. With eligible men aged between 18-60 not being allowed to leave Ukraine, news reports were filled with images of mostly women and young children fleeing the country, wrapped in blankets or with grandparents nearby.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like many of us, in the early days of the war, British photographer Polly Braden’s grasp of what was happening was informed by TV and newspaper coverage. In it, she recognized the correlation between what she was witnessing and her own practice. “I’d made this body of work about single parents (‘Holding the Baby,’ 2022), and seeing these women leaving Ukraine, I thought about everything they were going to have to do to support the children and older people they were bringing with them,” she told CNN in an interview.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lena telling her mum she was offered a job. London, June 2022. Courtesy Polly Braden\n",
      "\n",
      "Weeks after those initial reportage images began being shown, Braden flew to Moldova, which shares a border with Ukraine, inspired to work on a new series. “It felt important to record what was going to happen to these women. They were going to have to find housing, schooling, jobs… to build new lives,” she explained. “It also meant they suddenly became refugees — they might have been teachers, lawyers, important people in their community — what was that going to look like for them?” The project would ultimately become an exhibition called “Leaving Ukraine,” currently on display at the Foundling Museum in London.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course, it’s important we have pictures of the frontline and what’s happening inside Ukraine, but it’s also important we understand what role women play in war, especially this war, where women have given up their status in their country,” continued Braden, reflecting on the traditionally gendered approach to documenting conflict. “They are safeguarding the next generation of Ukraine.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Spanning two years (the most recent image was taken in early March 2024) and featuring a mix of still photography and moving image, “Leaving Ukraine” closely follows the stories of six women Braden met when she travelled to Moldova: law graduate Lena, pregnant mother Anya, school friends Sofiia, Aliesia and Yuliia, and Narine who left Ukraine with her children and a close friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conscious of the work’s broader scope, Braden considers “Leaving Ukraine” not just a depiction of these six women and their families, but also as a reflection of the countries they’ve ended up in, which include Italy, Poland and the UK. According to the UNHCR’s most recent report, Moldova has received over 850,000 Ukrainian refugees and more than 120,000 third country nationals since February 22, 2022. Of them, as of November 12, 2023, more than 113,000 have stayed on in the country.\n",

      "“I thought I’d meet people in a country then follow them building a life there, but not one person I met has landed in a country, found their feet and made it work,” she shared. “They’ve had to move because they can’t find work, there’s no housing, they can’t get their kid to school — or they’ve landed in the countryside in a country they’ve never been to.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Braden describes the project as wholly collaborative, detailing her close work with the women to construct an intimate portrait of their new reality (photographing Anya, for example, just hours after she gave birth). Many of the images are tender studies of private moments, shot in homes, social spaces and on public transport. “They’ve been telling their own story really, I’ve just been holding a camera,” she said.\n",

      "\n",
      "Lena, who Braden recalled had become irritated speaking to journalists in Moldova, later came to live with her in London. The photographer noted how they didn’t take any photos during this period. “I thought it was quite invasive,” she said, reflecting on the trust they’d developed. “After all it’s a privilege, (this work). And finding a new life is like a jigsaw, right?” Lena has since moved out, meeting a partner and having a baby, and Braden is conscious of how the war has affected her family’s trajectory. “The child hopefully will speak Ukrainian, but they’re an English family,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elsewhere, with two teenagers of her own, the photographer has taken great pleasure in working with the three schoolgirls, one of whom is now studying film in Warsaw and used the project in her coursework. “The most amazing part about following young people, like Sofiia, Aliesia and Yuliia, is they’re optimistic and full of the joys of life,” she said. “Wanting love and all the normal things young people want.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Initially, Braden had envisioned she’d be able to return to Ukraine with some of the women, but with the war now in its third year, that has not yet been possible. Ultimately she determined that the series is about building a life away from home, and “finding new paths in Europe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, her commitment to just a small group of families, in tandem with her long-term approach, allowed her to harness greater power in her storytelling. “If we don’t look at individual stories,” she clarified, “then big policies are made without understanding details.”\n",

      "Washed, peeled and scrubbed\n",
      "\n",
      "Each year, a rotating list of domestic and imported produce is tested by US Department of Agriculture and US Food and Drug Administration. Staffers at the USDA Pesticide Data Program wash, peel and scrub fruits and vegetables as consumers would, while workers at the FDA only brush dirt off the produce. Then the fruits and vegetables are tested for more than 250 different pesticides and the results are posted online.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 2024, EWG researchers examined testing data on 47,510 samples of 46 nonorganic fruits and vegetables, with the majority of testing from the USDA. An analysis of that data found traces of 254 pesticides in all fruits and vegetables analyzed, with 209 of those chemicals on produce in the “Dirty Dozen” list.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We find that what ends up on one list versus the other reflects how those fruits and vegetables are grown,” said Alexis Temkin, EWG’s senior toxicologist. “Avocados, for example, aren’t pesticide intensive, while strawberries grow very close to the ground and have a lot of pests.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Report is unfair to farmers, critics say\n",
      "\n",
      "About 70% of nonorganic produce tested by the USDA and FDA have pesticide levels within the legal limits allowed by the US Environmental Protection Agency, according to the EWG report. That fact makes the report misleading, said Carl Winter, emeritus professor of cooperative extension at the University of California, Davis.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The dose makes the poison, not its presence or its absence, and that dose determines the potential for harm. In many cases you’d have to be exposed to a million times more than what we’re exposed to before you’d even see any effects,” said Winter, speaking on behalf of the Alliance on Food and Farming, which represents organic and conventional farmers.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, “legal levels do not mean safe levels,” Temkin said in response. She pointed to times when regulators allowed potentially dangerous chemicals, such as the pesticide DCPA, to remain on the market long after scientific research had raised concerns. The herbicide was linked to thyroid concerns for years before the EPA told the public the chemical posed “significant risks to human health” in 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another example: chlorpyrifos, a pesticide linked to brain damage in children and fetuses. The American Academy of Pediatrics joined EWG in 2017 protesting the EPA’s continued approval of the chemical.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, pesticides banned by the government continue to show up on crops sold in the US, according to the EWG report.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Green beans for example, continue to show traces of acephate, a toxic pesticide the EPA banned for use on green beans more than 10 years ago,” Temkin said. “A lot of pesticides found on the ‘Dirty Dozen’ have also been banned in the European Union because of their harmful effects on human health.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Another concern from critics is that the “Dirty Dozen” list is insulting to multigenerational farmers who struggle to grow food for the nation and feed those same products to their own children, said Steve Clement, CEO of Pacific Northwest Tree Fruit\n",
      "\n",
      "“When this report comes out it’s like getting stabbed a little bit because we’re working so hard to put out a nice healthy product, and the implication of the ‘Dirty Dozen’ list is that it is unhealthy,” Clement said. “It’s like doing something kind for somebody and then having them turn around and call you some sort of monster.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The report may scare people away from eating the fruits and vegetables they need, said Neil Nagata, whose family has grown organic and conventional strawberries in Oceanside, California, for decades.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Every time the report comes out, or there’s a scare on imported strawberries, we see our sales drop off,” Nagata said. “It’s not as if we’re doing something that is wrong or incorrect, we’re actually producing very healthy, safe food. In fact, we actually live in the strawberry field and my father is 100 and my mom is 97, and they still eat strawberries.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Some farmers feel the term \"Dirty Dozen\" is insulting, according to the Alliance on Food and Farming. kcline/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important that people eat lots of fruits and vegetables, even conventionally grown, said EWG’s Temkin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We always emphasize that,” she said. “We want to enable consumers who wish to avoid as many pesticides as possible by opting for organic versions of the ‘Dirty Dozen,’ where pesticide levels will be lower, and then, if they wish, choose less expensive conventionally grown produce from the ‘Clean Fifteen.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "Organic produce is not more nutritious, but studies have found that levels of pesticides in the urine of adults and children can drop up to 95% after a switch to an organic diet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fungicide levels were high\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first time, EWG analysts looked at reported levels of fungicides, one form of pesticide used to kill fungal diseases such as powdery mildew.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Four out of five of the most frequently found pesticides on the ‘Dirty Dozen’ list were fungicides, and they were also found in particularly high concentrations,” Temkin said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two fungicides — fludioxonil and pyrimethanil — had the highest concentration on the “Dirty Dozen” list of any other pesticide, according to the report. Fludioxonil was found on 90% of peaches and nearly 30% of all “Dirty Dozen” samples, according to the report. Pyrimethanil was found on 65% of pear, 30% of apple, 27% of grape, 26% of strawberry and 24% of nectarine samples.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fungicides are often applied after harvest to keep produce mold-free on its way to market. That’s likely why the concentrations were so high on some samples – higher than other pesticides applied earlier in the growing season,” Temkin said. “The application of the fungicide is also closer to the time the produce is put on store shelves and consumers are eating them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Fludioxonil creates a waxy coating on the fruit or vegetable that studies find is difficult to wash away. While the EPA finds fludioxonil safe at regulated levels, some studies have raised concerns that it might disrupt hormone and neurological systems. Exposing breast cancer cells to fludioxonil in a petri dish found the fungicide increased cell production by 1.5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pyrimethanil was classified as a “possible human carcinogen” by the EPA in 2004, but the agency determined in 2015 the chemical was “not likely to be carcinogenic to humans” at low doses. Studies have shown it to be toxic to tree frogs and aquatic life, and it may disrupt thyroid levels in pregnant women living in agricultural areas. In lab tests, pyrimethanil and fludioxonil were show to impact androgen activity — hormones that contribute to growth and reproduction in both men and women.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ways to reduce pesticides in your food\n",
      "\n",
      "Cleaning fruits and vegetables before eating does reduce pesticide levels, but “no washing method is 100% effective for removing all pesticide residues,” according to the National Pesticide Information Center.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with clean hands, wash and rub produce under running water instead of soaking to remove the most pesticide, the center recommends on its website.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don’t use soap, detergent or a commercial soak or scrub, however, as they have not been proven to be any more effective, according to the FDA. Dry the produce with a clean cloth or paper towel to further reduce bacteria that may be present.\n",

      "\n",
      "Visible tensions are appearing in the historically close relationship between the White House and Israel, as the war in Gaza becomes a worsening humanitarian disaster and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu resists the Biden administration's push for a change in course. While Biden vocally supports Israel's stated goals of defeating Hamas and rescuing the hostages that the Palestinian militant group took captive during its Oct. 7 rampage in southern Israel that killed some 1,200 people, he and other administration officials have expressed increasing criticism of the way in which Israel is carrying out its operations in the Gaza Strip. Israel's relentless aerial bombardment and expanding ground invasion, as well as the cutting of Gaza's water and power supplies, have killed more than 30,000 Palestinians there, according to Gaza's health ministry, which is run by Hamas. And Israeli restrictions on the aid that can enter the besieged enclave, which is blockaded on all sides, have pushed more than 500,000 people into famine, according to the United Nations. Still, the Biden administration has rejected pulling back the military aid it is providing to Israel, and consistently provides diplomatic cover for it at the U.N., often being the sole country vetoing international demands for a cease-fire.\n",

      "\n",
      "Biden has also stressed what his administration says is the need for an independent Palestinian state as part of the path to a durable peace — something Netanyahu ardently opposes. The right-wing Israeli leader has also rejected Biden's proposals of a leading role for the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority in Gaza's future once the war ends. \"These and other divisions are putting the entire 'special relationship' between the U.S. and Israel under pressure I have never seen before in my lifetime,\" Hussein Ibish, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, told CNBC. \"The relationship [between Biden and Netanyahu] is absolutely terrible.\" A report by Politico in early February cited unnamed Biden administration officials describing the president calling Netanyahu a \"bad f—ng guy.\" His spokespeople have denied it, saying that the leaders have \"a decades-long relationship that is respectful in public and in private.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "The reported rift appeared to worsen as Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz, a longtime rival of Netanyahu and considered to be more moderate, paid a visit to Washington this week at the invitation of the White House. According to a report by Axios, the visit \"enraged\" Netanyahu, \"who ordered the Israeli embassy in Washington to not take any part in the visit or assist Gantz in any way.\" Gantz reportedly faced a barrage of harsh questions and critiques from the administration over Israel's handling of the Gaza war. CNBC has reached out to the White House and the Israeli Prime Minister's Office for comment.\n",

      "Election worries and 'campaign mode'\n",
      "\n",
      "As the U.S. General Election nears, promising a rematch between Biden and former President Donald Trump, Biden is facing a domestic challenge over his support for Israel's war in Gaza, particularly from many young liberals and Muslim and Arab Americans. This threatens to cost him crucial votes, particularly in swing states. Vice President Kamala Harris issued harsh comments in a speech on Sunday urging a cease-fire, saying \"People in Gaza are starving. The conditions are inhumane.\" And during his State of the Union speech Thursday, Biden lamented the scale of suffering in Gaza, saying, \"To the leadership of Israel I say this: Humanitarian assistance cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining chip. Protecting and saving innocent lives has to be a priority.\" He was later heard on a hot mic expressing his frustration with Netanyahu, saying that the two leaders will need to have a \"come to Jesus meeting.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "But Netanyahu is adamant that a cease-fire would threaten the Israeli Defense Force's momentum, and that \"total victory is within reach.\" Some observers say his rhetoric is aimed at staying in power as his domestic approval rating sits at its lowest of his more than 16 years at the helm. \"It seems to me that Netanyahu is in a full campaign mode, and that presently, its main theme is resisting the emerging Biden strategy and the president himself,\" said Nimrod Novik, a fellow at the Israel Policy Forum, which is dedicated to advancing a two-state outcome to the conflict. Particularly telling, Novik said, is \"Netanyahu's decision to preempt the emerging Biden strategy – which offers Israel a way out of Gaza, a hopeful change on the West Bank, as well as Saudi normalization and regional integration – by distorting this unprecedented offer and portraying it as an imposition.\" \"The prime minister is focused on securing and energizing his ever-shrinking base,\" he said of Netanyahu. \"That base is as hard line as they come and responds best to nationalist machismo as in his promise to defend Israel from the imagined Biden imposition of a Palestinian state.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I've watched the [Biden] administration express its being fed up with the Netanyahu policy, from haggling over every truck of humanitarian assistance, through announcing West Bank triggering settlement expansion at such an explosive moment, to provocations on Temple Mount on the eve of the holy Muslim month of Ramadan,\" Novik said. But this is going largely ignored in the Israeli administration, he noted. \"What might sound in Washington as a scream is hardly a whisper in Jerusalem.\" Ibish had similar observations. \"All the American support, especially from Biden personally, is being met with total ingratitude and actually with disdain,\" from Netanyahu's government, he said. \"If Biden were getting more cooperation from Netanyahu [and] the Israelis, he would not be pulling away from them, albeit carefully and subtly. This is, after all, an election year, and he will have to be very careful.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Unprecedented support\n",
      "\n",
      "Yonatan Freeman, an international relations and media lecturer at Israel's Hebrew University, believes the historically close relationship between the two countries will supersede the relationships between individual administrations and leaders. \"I think looking from a bird's eye view we have to really focus on U.S.-Israel relations. And I don't remember another war that Israel fought where it received so much support from a U.S. administration,\" Freeman said. \"Just as one example, the airlifting of U.S. military equipment to Israel occurred almost immediately … it never stopped.\" Still, he added, there is a broad perception among Israelis and many American Jews that former president Donald Trump was the most pro-Israel president in U.S. history. \"I think that this might be critical in some of the swing states where we have large Jewish and Israeli-American populations.\" Roughly a quarter of Americans also identify as Evangelical Christian, a group that typically is very pro-Israel. \"So yes, this is something that could impact the elections,\" Freeman said, adding that Biden's hope of achieving normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia is also on hold for the time being. \"That would bring him great points in terms of Israel, but also in terms of foreign policy, where Biden is looking for successes on the world stage,\" he said. \"But it seems like there aren't many.\"\n",
